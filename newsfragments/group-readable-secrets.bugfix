Enhanced the accessibility of secret files by enabling group-readability.
Previously, secret files were exclusively accessible to the owner. Now,
accessibility has been expanded to allow group members access as well. This
enhancement is particularly beneficial when utilizing Systemd's LoadCredential
feature, which configures secrets with group-readable (0o440) permissions.
