Added ``merge_streams`` option to ``ShellCommand`` and other shell-based build steps. When set to ``True``, stderr output is merged into the stdout stream by the build step implementation, providing a single combined output stream without requiring PTY or shell-level redirection. When ``merge_streams`` is enabled, stderr is no longer available as a separate stream: ``collectStderr`` will still accumulate the data, but it will also appear in stdout (:issue:`2999`).
