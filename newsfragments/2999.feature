Added ``merge_streams`` option to ``ShellCommand`` and other shell-based build steps. When set to ``True``, stderr output is routed through stdout at the protocol level, so both streams appear combined in the build log. This is useful when interleaved output ordering matters but a PTY is not desired (:issue:`2999`).
