* Buildbot-Slave 0.8.4

** Buildslave now places all spawned commands into process groups on POSIX
systems.  This means that in most cases child processes are cleaned up
properly, and removes the most common use for usePTY.  As of this version,
usePTY should be set to False for almost all users of Buildbot.

** Init script now uses /etc/default/buildslave for instance configuration.
Also SLAVE_ENABLED used in /etc/default/buildslave now accepts 'true|yes|1'
to enable instance and 'false|no|0' to disable(not case sensitive). Other
values will be considered as syntax error.


* Buildbot-Slave 0.8.3 (December 19, 2010)

** Slave-initiated Graceful Shutdown

If the allow_shutdown parameter in buildbot.tac is set, then the slave can be
gracefully shut down locally by the slave admin.  The shutdown operates by the
slave informing the master that it would like to shut down; the master then
finishes any active builds on the slave, and instructs the slave to shut down.
See the documentation for more information.


* Buildbot-Slave 0.8.2 (October 29, 2010)

** Log Rotation

The default 'create-slave' output now rotates ten twistd.log files, each of
about 10MiB.  This is a change from older versions, which would rotate an
unbounded number of 1MiB files.

** twistd.hostname

On startup, the buildslave writes its hostname to twistd.hostname.  This is
intended to contextualize twistd.pid, which does not specify the host on which
the buildslave is running.


* Buildbot-Slave 0.8.1

** First release of buildslave as a separate package

** Fixes

*** Command-line options changed

Added new `-n|--no-logrotate` flag to create-slave command which disables
internal logging and log rotation mechanism in buildbot.tac (ticket #973)

*** Delete srcdir before retrying git clone (ticket #884)

*** Fix setup.py to install a launcher script properly in all cases.
