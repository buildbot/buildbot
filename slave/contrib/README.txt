Utility scripts, things contributed by users but not strictly a part of
buildbot:

zsh/_buildslave: zsh tab-completion file for 'buildslave' command. Put it in
                 one of the directories appearing in $fpath to enable
                 tab-completion in zsh.

bash/buildslave: bash tab-completion file for 'buildslave' command. Source this
                 file to enable completions in your bash session. This is
                 typically accomplished by placing the file into the
                 appropriate 'bash_completion.d' directory.
