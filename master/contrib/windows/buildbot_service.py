# Runs the build-bot as a Windows service.
# To use:
# * Install and configure buildbot as per normal (ie, running
#  'setup.py install' from the source directory).
#
# * Configure any number of build-bot directories (slaves or masters), as
#   per the buildbot instructions.  Test these directories normally by
#   using the (possibly modified) "buildbot.bat" file and ensure everything
#   is working as expected.
#
# * Install the buildbot service.  Execute the command:
#   % python buildbot_service.py
#   To see installation options.  You probably want to specify:
#   + --username and --password options to specify the user to run the
#   + --startup auto to have the service start at boot time.
#
#   For example:
#   % python buildbot_service.py --user mark --password secret \
#     --startup auto install
#   Alternatively, you could execute:
#   % python buildbot_service.py install
#   to install the service with default options, then use Control Panel
#   to configure it.
#
# * Start the service specifying the name of all buildbot directories as
#   service args.  This can be done one of 2 ways:
#   - Execute the command:
#     % python buildbot_service.py start "dir_name1" "dir_name2"
#   or:
#   - Start Control Panel->Administrative Tools->Services
#   - Locate the previously installed buildbot service.
#   - Open the "properties" for the service.
#   - Enter the directory names into the "Start Parameters" textbox.  The
#     directory names must be fully qualified, and surrounded in quotes if
#    they include spaces.
#   - Press the "Start"button.
#   Note that the service will automatically use the previously specified
#   directories if no arguments are specified. This means the directories
#   need only be specified when the directories to use have changed (and
#   therefore also the first time buildbot is configured)
#
# * The service should now be running.  You should check the Windows
#   event log.  If all goes well, you should see some information messages
#   telling you the buildbot has successfully started.
#
# * If you change the buildbot configuration, you must restart the service.
#   There is currently no way to ask a running buildbot to reload the
#   config.  You can restart by executing:
#   % python buildbot_service.py restart
#
# Troubleshooting:
# * Check the Windows event log for any errors.
# * Check the "twistd.log" file in your buildbot directories - once each
#   bot has been started it just writes to this log as normal.
# * Try executing:
#   % python buildbot_service.py debug
#   This will execute the buildbot service in "debug" mode, and allow you to
#   see all messages etc generated. If the service works in debug mode but
#   not as a real service, the error probably relates to the environment or
#   permissions of the user configured to run the service (debug mode runs as
#   the currently logged in user, not the service user)
# * Ensure you have the latest pywin32 build available, at least version 206.
