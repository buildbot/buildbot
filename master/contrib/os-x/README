Mark Pauley contributed the two launchd plist files for OS-X (10.4+) to start
a buildmaster or buildslave automatically at startup:

 contrib/OS-X/net.sourceforge.buildbot.master.plist
 contrib/OS-X/net.sourceforge.buildbot.slave.plist

  Hi guys,
  	I've had these kicking around for a while and thought that maybe
  someone would like to see them.  Installing either of these two to /
  Library/LaunchDaemons will cause the bulidbot slave or master to auto-
  start as whatever user you like on launch.  This is the "right way to
  do this" going forward, startupitems are deprecated.  Please note that
  this means any tests that require a windowserver connection on os x
  won't work.
