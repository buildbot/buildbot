#compdef buildbot
#
# This is the ZSH completion file for 'buildbot' command. It calls 'buildbot'
# command with the special "--_shell-completion" option which is handled
# by twisted.python.usage. t.p.usage then generates zsh code on stdout to
# handle the completions.
#
# This file is derived from twisted/python/twisted-completion.zsh from twisted
# distribution.
#

# redirect stderr to /dev/null otherwise deprecation warnings may get puked all
# over the user's terminal if completing options for a deprecated command.
# Redirect stderr to a file to debug errors.
