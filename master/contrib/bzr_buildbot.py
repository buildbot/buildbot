bzr buildbot integration
========================

This file contains both bzr commit/change hooks and a bzr poller.

------------
Requirements
------------

This has been tested with buildbot 0.7.9, bzr 1.10, and Twisted 8.1.0.  It
should work in subsequent releases.

For the hook to work, Twisted must be installed in the same Python that bzr
uses.

-----
Hooks
-----

To install, put this file in a bzr plugins directory (e.g.,
~/.bazaar/plugins). Then, in one of your bazaar conf files (e.g.,
~/.bazaar/locations.conf), set the location you want to connect with buildbot
with these keys:

- buildbot_on: one of 'commit', 'push, or 'change'.  Turns the plugin on to
  report changes via commit, changes via push, or any changes to the trunk.
  'change' is recommended.

- buildbot_server: (required to send to a buildbot master) the URL of the
  buildbot master to which you will connect (as of this writing, the same
  server and port to which slaves connect).

- buildbot_port: (optional, defaults to 9989) the port of the buildbot master
  to which you will connect (as of this writing, the same server and port to
  which slaves connect)

- buildbot_auth: (optional, defaults to change:changepw) the credentials
  expected by the change source configuration in the master. Takes the
  "user:password" form.

- buildbot_pqm: (optional, defaults to not pqm) Normally, the user that
  commits the revision is the user that is responsible for the change.  When
  run in a pqm (Patch Queue Manager, see https://launchpad.net/pqm)
  environment, the user that commits is the Patch Queue Manager, and the user
  that committed the *parent* revision is responsible for the change.  To turn
  on the pqm mode, set this value to any of (case-insensitive) "Yes", "Y",
  "True", or "T".

- buildbot_dry_run: (optional, defaults to not a dry run) Normally, the
  post-commit hook will attempt to communicate with the configured buildbot
  server and port. If this parameter is included and any of (case-insensitive)
  "Yes", "Y", "True", or "T", then the hook will simply print what it would
  have sent, but not attempt to contact the buildbot master.

- buildbot_send_branch_name: (optional, defaults to not sending the branch
  name) If your buildbot's bzr source build step uses a repourl, do
  *not* turn this on. If your buildbot's bzr build step uses a baseURL, then
  you may set this value to any of (case-insensitive) "Yes", "Y", "True", or
  "T" to have the buildbot master append the branch name to the baseURL.

Note: The bzr smart server (as of version 2.2.2) doesn't know how to resolve
bzr:// urls into absolute paths so any paths in locations.conf won't match,
hence no change notifications will be sent to Buildbot. Setting configuration
parameters globally or in-branch might still work.

When buildbot no longer has a hardcoded password, it will be a configuration
option here as well.
