Release Notes
=============

..
    Any change that adds a feature or fixes a bug should have an entry here.
    Most simply need an additional bulleted list item, but more significant
    changes can be given a subsection of their own.

The following are the release notes for Buildbot |version|.

Master
------

Deprecations, Removals, and Non-Compatible Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Forced builds now require that a :bb:sched:`ForceScheduler` be defined in the
  Buildbot configuration.  For compatible behavior, this should look like::

    from buildbot.schedulers.forcesched import ForceScheduler
    c['schedulers'].append(ForceScheduler(
                            name="force",
                            builderNames=["b1", "b2", ... ]))

  Where all of the builder names in the configuration are listed.  See the
  documentation for the *much* more flexiblie configuration options now
  available.

* ``buildbot start`` no longer invokes make if a ``Makefile.buildbot`` exists.
  If you are using this functionality, consider invoking make directly.

* The ``buildbot sendchange`` option ``--username`` has been removed as
  promised in :bb:bug:`1711`.

* StatusReceivers' checkConfig method should now take an additional `errors`
  parameter and call its :py:meth:`~buildbot.config.ConfigErrors.addError`
  method to indicate errors.

* The gerrit status callback now gets an additional parameter (the master
  status).  If you use this callback, you will need to adjust its
  implementation.

* This is the last release of Buildbot that will be compatible with Python 2.4.
  The next version will minimally require Python-2.5.

Changes for Developers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The interface for runtime access to the master's configuration has changed
  considerably.  See :doc:`developer/config` for more details.

* The DB connector methods ``completeBuildset``, ``completeBuildRequest``, and
  ``claimBuildRequest`` now take an optional ``complete_at`` parameter to
  specify the completion time explicitly.

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Buildbot can now take advantage of authentication done by a front-end web
  server - see :bb:pull:`266`.

* Buildbot supports a simple cookie-based login system, so users no longer need
  to enter a username and password for every request.  See the earlier commits
  in :bb:pull:`278`.

* The master-side SVN step now has an `export` method which is similar to
  `copy`, but the build directory does not contain Subversion metdata. (:bb:bug:`2078`)

* :py:class:`Property` instances will now render any properties in the
  default value if necessary.  This makes possible constructs like ::

    command=Property('command', default=Property('default-command'))

* Buildbot has a new web hook to handle push notifications from Google Code -
  see :bb:pull:`278`.

* Revision links are now generated by a flexible runtime conversion configured
  by :bb:cfg:`revlink` - see :bb:pull:`280`.

* Shell command steps will now "flatten" nested lists in the ``command``
  argument.  This allows substitution of multiple command-line arguments using
  properties.  See :bb:bug:`2150`.

* :py:class:`Trigger` steps with ``waitForFinish=True`` now receive a URL to
  all the triggered builds. This URL is displayed in the waterfall and build
  details. Also, the statistic ``triggered_builds`` is set in the ``StepStatus``
  to a list of build dictionaries. See :bb:bug:`2170`.
