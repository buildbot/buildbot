Release Notes for Buildbot |version|
====================================

..
    Any change that adds a feature or fixes a bug should have an entry here.
    Most simply need an additional bulleted list item, but more significant
    changes can be given a subsection of their own.

The following are the release notes for Buildbot |version|.

Master
------

Deprecations, Removals, and Non-Compatible Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Buildbot master now requires at least Python-2.5 and Twisted-9.0.0.

* Buildbot master requires ``python-dateutil`` version 1.5 to support the
  Nightly scheduler.

* The configurable callable build.workdir has changed his parameterlist. Instead
  of a single sourcestamp a list of sourcestamps is passed. Each sourcestamp in 
  the list has a different :ref:`codebase<Attr-Codebase>`

* BK support has been removed in this release - see :bb:bug:`2198`.

* The undocumented renderable ``_ComputeRepositoryURL`` is no longer imported to
  :py:mod:`buildbot.steps.source`. It is still available at
  :py:mod:`buildbot.steps.source.oldsource`.

* ``IProperties.render`` now returns a deferred, so any code rendering properties
  by hand will need to take this into account.

* ``baseURL`` has been removed in :bb:step:`SVN` to use just ``repourl`` - see
  :bb:bug:`2066`. Branch info should be provided with ``Interpolate``. ::

    from buildbot.steps.source.svn import SVN
    factory.append(SVN(baseURL="svn://svn.example.org/svn/"))

  can be replaced with ::

    from buildbot.process.properties import Interpolate
    from buildbot.steps.source.svn import SVN
    factory.append(SVN(repourl=Interpolate("svn://svn.example.org/svn/%(src::branch)s")))

  and ::

    from buildbot.steps.source.svn import SVN
    factory.append(SVN(baseURL="svn://svn.example.org/svn/%%BRANCH%%/project"))

  can be replaced with ::

    from buildbot.process.properties import Interpolate
    from buildbot.steps.source.svn import SVN
    factory.append(SVN(repourl=Interpolate("svn://svn.example.org/svn/%(src::branch)s/project")))

  and ::

    from buildbot.steps.source.svn import SVN
    factory.append(SVN(baseURL="svn://svn.example.org/svn/", defaultBranch="branches/test"))

  can be replaced with ::

    from buildbot.process.properties import Interpolate
    from buildbot.steps.source.svn import SVN
    factory.append(SVN(repourl=Interpolate("svn://svn.example.org/svn/%(src::branch:-branches/test)s")))

* ``Source`` and ``ShellCommand`` steps now have an optional ``descriptionSuffix``, a suffix to the
   ``description``/``descriptionDone`` values. For example this can help distinguish between
    multiple ``Compile`` steps that are applied to different codebases.

Changes for Developers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * ``BuildStep.start`` can now optionally return a deferred and any errback
   will be handled gracefully. If you use inlineCallbacks, this means that
   unexpected exceptions and failures raised will be captured and logged and
   the build shut down normally.
