Release Notes for Buildbot |version|
====================================

Nine
----

..
    For the moment, release notes for the nine branch go here, for ease of merging.

* Buildbot's tests now require at least Mock-0.8.0.

* Buildbot no longer polls the database for jobs.  The
  :bb:cfg:`db_poll_interval` configuration parameter and the :bb:cfg:`db` key
  of the same name are deprecated and will be ignored.

* The interface for adding changes has changed.
  The new method is :py:meth:`~buildbot.data.changes.ChangeResourceType.addChange` (invoked as ``master.data.updates.addChange``), although the old interface (``master.addChange``) will remain in place for a few versions.
  The new method:

  * returns a change ID, not a Change instance;

  * takes its ``when_timestamp`` argument as epoch time (UNIX time), not a datetime instance; and

  * does not accept the deprecated parameters ``who``, ``isdir``, ``is_dir``, and ``when``.

  * requires that all strings be unicode, not bytestrings.

  Please adjust any custom change sources accordingly.

..
    Any change that adds a feature or fixes a bug should have an entry here.
    Most simply need an additional bulleted list item, but more significant
    changes can be given a subsection of their own.

The following are the release notes for Buildbot |version|.

Master
------

Deprecations, Removals, and Non-Compatible Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Buildbot master now requires at least Python-2.5 and Twisted-9.0.0.

* Buildbot master requires ``python-dateutil`` version 1.5 to support the
  Nightly scheduler.

* The configurable callable build.workdir has changed his parameterlist. Instead
  of a single sourcestamp a list of sourcestamps is passed. Each sourcestamp in 
  the list has a different :ref:`codebase<Attr-Codebase>`

* BK support has been removed in this release - see :bb:bug:`2198`.

* The undocumented renderable ``_ComputeRepositoryURL`` is no longer imported to
  :py:mod:`buildbot.steps.source`. It is still available at
  :py:mod:`buildbot.steps.source.oldsource`.

* ``IProperties.render`` now returns a deferred, so any code rendering properties
  by hand will need to take this into account.

* ``baseURL`` has been removed in :bb:step:`SVN` to use just ``repourl`` - see
  :bb:bug:`2066`. Branch info should be provided with ``Interpolate``. ::

    from buildbot.steps.source.svn import SVN
    factory.append(SVN(baseURL="svn://svn.example.org/svn/"))

  can be replaced with ::

    from buildbot.process.properties import Interpolate
    from buildbot.steps.source.svn import SVN
    factory.append(SVN(repourl=Interpolate("svn://svn.example.org/svn/%(src::branch)s")))

  and ::

    from buildbot.steps.source.svn import SVN
    factory.append(SVN(baseURL="svn://svn.example.org/svn/%%BRANCH%%/project"))

  can be replaced with ::

    from buildbot.process.properties import Interpolate
    from buildbot.steps.source.svn import SVN
    factory.append(SVN(repourl=Interpolate("svn://svn.example.org/svn/%(src::branch)s/project")))

  and ::

    from buildbot.steps.source.svn import SVN
    factory.append(SVN(baseURL="svn://svn.example.org/svn/", defaultBranch="branches/test"))

  can be replaced with ::

    from buildbot.process.properties import Interpolate
    from buildbot.steps.source.svn import SVN
    factory.append(SVN(repourl=Interpolate("svn://svn.example.org/svn/%(src::branch:-branches/test)s")))

* The ``P4Sync`` step, deprecated since 0.8.5, has been removed.  The ``P4`` step remains.

Changes for Developers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``BuildStep.start`` can now optionally return a deferred and any errback will
  be handled gracefully. If you use inlineCallbacks, this means that unexpected
  exceptions and failures raised will be captured and logged and the build shut
  down normally.

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Buildbot now supports building projects composed of multiple codebases.  New
  schedulers can aggregate changes to multiple codebases into source stamp sets
  (with one source stamp for each codebase).  Source steps then check out each
  codebase as required, and the remainder of the build process proceeds
  normally.  See the :ref:`Multiple-Codebase-Builds` for details.

* ``Source`` and ``ShellCommand`` steps now have an optional ``descriptionSuffix``, a suffix to the
   ``description``/``descriptionDone`` values. For example this can help distinguish between
    multiple ``Compile`` steps that are applied to different codebases.

* ``Git`` has a new ``getDescription`` option, which will run `git describe` after checkout
  normally.  See the documentation for details.

* A new ternary substitution operator ``:?:`` and ``:#?:`` to use with the ``Interpolate``
  and ``WithProperties`` classes.

* The mercurial hook now supports multple masters.  See :bb:pull:`436`.
