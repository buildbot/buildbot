Buildbot 0.3.2 was released 7 May 2003

** packaging changes

*** fix major packaging bug: none of the buildbot/* subdirectories were
included in the 0.3.1 release. Sorry, I'm still figuring out distutils
here..

** internal changes

*** use pb.Cacheable to update Events in remote status client. much cleaner.

*** start to clean up BuildProcess->status.builder interface

** bug fixes

*** waterfall display was missing a <tr>, causing it to be misrendered in most
browsers (except the one I was testing it with, of course)

*** URL without trailing slash (when served in a twisted-web distributed
server, with a url like "http://twistedmatrix.com/~warner.twistd") should do
redirect to URL-with-trailing-slash, otherwise internal hrefs are broken.

*** remote status clients: forget RemoteReferences at shutdown, removes
warnings about "persisting Ephemerals"

** Twisted buildprocess updates:

*** match build process as of twisted-1.0.5
**** use python2.2 everywhere now that twisted rejects python2.1
**** look for test-result constants in multiple places
*** move experimental 'trial --jelly' code to separate module
*** add FreeBSD builder
*** catch rc!=0 in HLint step
*** remove RunUnitTestsRandomly, use randomly=1 parameter instead
*** parameterize ['twisted.test'] default test case to make subclassing easier
*** ignore internal distutils warnings in python2.3 builder
