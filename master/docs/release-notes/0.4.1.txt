Buildbot-0.4.1 was released 09 Dec 2003

** MaildirSources fixed

Several bugs in MaildirSource made them unusable. These have been fixed (for
real this time). The Twisted buildbot is using an FCMaildirSource while they
fix some FreshCVS daemon problems, which provided the encouragement for
getting these bugs fixed.

In addition, the use of DNotify (only available under linux) was somehow
broken, possibly by changes in some recent version of Python. It appears to
be working again now (against both python-2.3.3c1 and python-2.2.1).

** master.cfg can use 'basedir' variable

As documented in the sample configuration file (but not actually implemented
until now), a variable named 'basedir' is inserted into the namespace used
by master.cfg . This can be used with something like:

  os.path.join(basedir, "maildir")

to obtain a master-basedir-relative location.
