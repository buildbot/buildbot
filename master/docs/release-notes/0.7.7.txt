Buildbot 0.7.7 was released 28 Mar 2008

** Things You Need To Know

*** builder names must not start with an underscore (`_').

These are now reserved for internal buildbot purposes, such as the magic
"_all" pseudo-builder that the web pages use to allow force-build buttons
that start builds on all Builders at once.

** New Features

*** "buildbot checkconfig"

The "buildbot checkconfig" command will look at your master.cfg file and tell
you if there are any problems with it. This can be used to test potential
changes to your config file before submitting them to the running
buildmaster. This is particularly useful to run just before doing "buildbot
restart", since the restart will fail if the config file has an error. By
running "buildbot checkconfig master.cfg && buildbot restart", you'll only
perform the restart if the config file was ok. Many thanks to Ben Hearsum for
the patch.

*** Waterfall "?category=FOO" query-arguments

The Waterfall page now accepts one or more "category=" query arguments in the
URL, to filter the display by categories. These behave a lot like the
"builder=" query argument. Thanks to Jermo Davann for the patch.

** Bugs Fixed

Many bugs were fixed, and many minor features were added. Many thanks to
Dustin Mitchell who fixed and coordinated many of these. Here is a terse
list, for more details, please see the Trac page for the 0.7.7 release, at
http://buildbot.net/trac/query?status=closed&milestone=0.7.7 :

Many of the URLs generated by the buildbot were wrong.
Display of last-heard-from timestamps on the buildslaves web page were wrong.
Asking an IRC bot about a build waiting on a Lock should no longer crash.
Same for the web viewer.
Stop treating the encouraged info/ directory as leftover.
Add more force/stop build buttons.
Timestamps displayed on the waterfall now handle daylight savings properly.
p4poller no longer quits after a single failure.
Improved Git support, including 'try', branch, and revisions.
Buildslaves now use 'git', not 'cogito'.
Make older hg client/servers handle specific-revision builds properly.
Fix twisted.scripts._twistw problem on twisted-2.5.0 and windows.
Fix workdir= and env= on ShellCommands
Fix logfile-watching in 'buildbot start' on OS-X.
Fix ShellCommand crashes when the program emits >640kB of output per chunk.
New WarningCountingShellCommand step.
Fix TreeSize step.
Fix transfer.FileUpload/FileDownload crashes for large files.
Make 'buildbor reconfig' on windows tell you that it doesn't work.
Add a To: header to the mail sent by the slave-missing timeout.
Disable usePTY= for most unit tests, it makes some debian systems flunk tests.
Add 'absolute source stamps'
Add 'triggerable schedulers', and a buildstep to trigger them.
Remove buildbot.changes.freshcvsmail
Add new XMLRPC methods: getAllBuilders, getStatus, getLastBuilds.
Accept WithProperties in more places: env=, workdir=, others.
Use --no-auth-cache with SVN commands to avoid clobbering shared svn state.
Add hours/minutes/seconds in the waterfall's ETA display.
Trial: count Doctest lines too.
ShellCommand: record more info in the headers: stdin closing, PTY usage.
Make it possible to stop builds across reconfig boundaries.
SVN revision numbers are now passed as strings, which was breaking MailNotifier
