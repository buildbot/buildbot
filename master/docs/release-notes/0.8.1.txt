Buildbot 0.8.1 was released 16 June 2010

** Slave Split into separate component

Installing 'buildbot' will no longer allow you to run a slave - for that,
you'll now need the 'buildslave' component, which is available by easy_install.
This is merely a packaging change - the buildslave and buildbot components are
completely inter-compatible, just as they always have been.

** Features

*** Add googlecode_atom.py to contrib (ticket #842)

*** Implement clean master shutdown, available through WebStatus

** Fixes

*** Pass local environment variables along with getProcessOutput. Required for
    ssh agent authentication.

*** IRC doc fixes (ticket #852)

*** Remove builder count from one_line_per_build (ticket #854)

*** Set the 'revision' property more often (ticket #101)

*** Change property priority ordering (ticket #809)

*** Fixes to MaildirSource for CVS

*** Use shutil.rmtree on POSIX systems

*** Fix NameError in MailNotifier (ticket #758)

*** Reduce verbosity of patches in twistd.log (ticket #803)

*** Documentation updates to reflect UI customization via
    templates (ticket #866)

** Deprecations

*** Arch, Bazaar, and Monotone to be removed in 0.8.2

This decision isn't final, but support for these VC's will be removed in
version 0.8.2 unless a maintainers steps forward to document, test, and update
them.

*** Support for starting buildmaster from Makefiles to be removed in 0.8.2

In a little-used feature, 'buildbot start' would run 'make start' if a
Makefile.buildbot existed in the master directory.  This functionality will be
removed in Buildbot-0.8.2, and the create-master command will no longer create
a Makefile.sample.  Of course, Buildbot still supports build processes on the
slave using make!

* Slave Changes

** First release of buildslave as a separate package

** Fixes

*** Command-line options changed

Added new `-n|--no-logrotate` flag to create-slave command which disables
internal logging and log rotation mechanism in buildbot.tac (ticket #973)

*** Delete srcdir before retrying git clone (ticket #884)

*** Fix setup.py to install a launcher script properly in all cases.
