Buildbot 0.7.12 was released 21 Jan 2010

** New 'console' display

This is a new web status view combining the best of the (t)grid and waterfall
views.

** New 'extended' stylesheet

Buildbot has a new, much nicer stylesheet available.  Copy the file
buildbot/status/web/extended.css over your existing public_html/buildbot.css to
se it.

** Builders can be configured with an object

Instead of a list of dictionaries, builders can now specified using a
BuilderConfig object in the configuration file.  This will allow for better
argument checking and default values, and also makes it easier for users to
create subclasses to handle site-specific builder details.  The old,
dictionary-based method of configuration is still supported.

** Check for common mis-configuration in addStep

When adding a new step to a factory, either of these are acceptable:

  f.addStep(ShellCommand(command="echo hello, world", description="say hi"))
  f.addStep(ShellCommand, command="echo hello, world", description="say hi")

but trying to mix these syntaxes is a common misconfiguration:

  f.addStep(ShellCommand(command="echo hello, world"), description="say hi")

in which case the description argument was silently ignored.  This is now an
error.

** Support for log compression

Log files can be compressed on the master side using either gzip or bzip2.

** Builder.ping no longer accepts timeout argument (bug #664).

The implementation was not robust enough and could cause the master to
unexpectedly disconnect the slave.

** MailNotifier's customMesg replaced by messageFormatter

The customMesg mechanism had the unfortunate side effect of loading all data
for a build into memory simultaneously, which for some builds could cause
memory exhaustion.

** Suppression of selected compiler warnings

The WarningCountingShellCommand class has been extended with the ability to
upload from the slave a file contain warnings to be ignored. See the
documentation of the suppressionFile argument to the Compile build step.

** New buildstep `MTR'

A new class buildbot.process.mtrlogobserver.MTR was added. This buildstep is
used to run test suites using mysql-test-run. It parses the stdio output for
test failures and summarises them on the waterfall page. It also makes server
error logs available for debugging failures, and optionally inserts
information about test runs and test failures into an external database.

** Python API Docs

The docstrings for buildbot are now available in a web-friendly format:

** Many, many bugfixes
