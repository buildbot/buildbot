Buildbot Guides
===============

These guides focus on one specific thing -- either a particular version control system, or a particular feature of Buildbot -- and show its various aspects.

The level of these guides is a bit higher than the one of :doc:`tutorials <../tutorial/index>`, however they should be easily followed together with the reference documentation that is pointed to in them.
