Configuration
=============

The following sections describe the configuration of the various Buildbot components.
The information available here is sufficient to create basic build and test configurations, and does not assume great familiarity with Python.

In more advanced Buildbot configurations, Buildbot acts as a framework for a continuous-integration application.
The next section, :doc:`customization`, describes this approach, with frequent references into the :ref:`development documentation <Buildbot Development>`.
