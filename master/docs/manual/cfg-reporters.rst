   Report targets are being migrated to Data API and not all status targets had been ported.
   These have an explicit warning before their description and are marked as such in the section title (to make it easier to distinguish them in the table of contents).
   As the old status targets are migrated to the new API, the warnings and markings will be removed.

The Buildmaster has a variety of ways to present build status to various users.
Each such delivery method is a `Reporter Target` object in the configuration's ``services`` list.
To add reporter targets, you just append more objects to this list::

    c['services'] = []

    m = reporters.MailNotifier(fromaddr="buildbot@localhost",
                               extraRecipients=["builds@lists.example.com"],
                               sendToInterestedUsers=False)
    c['services'].append(m)

    c['services'].append(reporters.IRC(host="irc.example.com", nick="bb",
                                      channels=[{"channel": "#example1"},
                                                {"channel": "#example2",
                                                 "password": "somesecretpassword"}]))

Most reporter objects take a ``tags=`` argument, which can contain a list of tag names: in this case, it will only show status for Builders that contains the named tags.

.. note:: Implementation Note

    Each of these objects should be a :class:`service.BuildbotService` which will be attached to the BuildMaster object when the configuration is processed.

The remainder of this section describes each built-in reporters.
A full list of reporters is available in the :bb:index:`reporter`.

MailNotifier
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. py:class:: buildbot.reporter.mail.MailNotifier

The Buildbot can send email when builds finish.
The most common use of this is to tell developers when their change has caused the build to fail.
It is also quite common to send a message to a mailing list (usually named `builds` or similar) about every build.

The :class:`MailNotifier` status target is used to accomplish this.
You configure it by specifying who mail should be sent to, under what circumstances mail should be sent, and how to deliver the mail.
It can be configured to only send out mail for certain builders, and only send messages when the build fails, or when the builder transitions from success to failure.
It can also be configured to include various build logs in each message.

If a proper lookup function is configured, the message will be sent to the "interested users" list (:ref:`Doing-Things-With-Users`), which includes all developers who made changes in the build.
By default, however, Buildbot does not know how to construct an email addressed based on the information from the version control system.
See the ``lookup`` argument, below, for more information.

You can add additional, statically-configured, recipients with the ``extraRecipients`` argument.
You can also add interested users by setting the ``owners`` build property to a list of users in the scheduler constructor (:ref:`Configuring-Schedulers`).

Each :class:`MailNotifier` sends mail to a single set of recipients.
To send different kinds of mail to different recipients, use multiple :class:`MailNotifier`\s.
TODO: or subclass MailNotifier and override getRecipients()


The following simple example will send an email upon the completion of each build, to just those developers whose :class:`Change`\s were included in the build.
The email contains a description of the :class:`Build`, its results, and URLs where more information can be obtained.

::

    from buildbot.plugins import reporters
    mn = reporters.MailNotifier(fromaddr="buildbot@example.org",
                                lookup="example.org")
    c['services'].append(mn)

To get a simple one-message-per-build (say, for a mailing list), use the following form instead.
This form does not send mail to individual developers (and thus does not need the ``lookup=`` argument, explained below), instead it only ever sends mail to the `extra recipients` named in the arguments::

    mn = reporters.MailNotifier(fromaddr="buildbot@example.org",
                                sendToInterestedUsers=False,
                                extraRecipients=['listaddr@example.org'])

If your SMTP host requires authentication before it allows you to send emails, this can also be done by specifying ``smtpUser`` and ``smtpPassword``::

    mn = reporters.MailNotifier(fromaddr="myuser@example.com",
                                sendToInterestedUsers=False,
                                extraRecipients=["listaddr@example.org"],
                                relayhost="smtp.example.com", smtpPort=587,
                                smtpUser="myuser@example.com",
                                smtpPassword="mypassword")

.. note::

   If for some reasons you are not able to send a notification with TLS enabled and specified user name and password, you might want to use :file:`contrib/check-smtp.py` to see if it works at all.

If you want to require Transport Layer Security (TLS), then you can also set ``useTls``::

    mn = reporters.MailNotifier(fromaddr="myuser@example.com",
                                sendToInterestedUsers=False,
                                extraRecipients=["listaddr@example.org"],
                                useTls=True, relayhost="smtp.example.com",
                                smtpPort=587, smtpUser="myuser@example.com",
                                smtpPassword="mypassword")

.. note::

   If you see ``twisted.mail.smtp.TLSRequiredError`` exceptions in the log while using TLS, this can be due *either* to the server not supporting TLS or to a missing `PyOpenSSL`_ package on the BuildMaster system.

In some cases it is desirable to have different information then what is provided in a standard MailNotifier message.
For this purpose MailNotifier provides the argument ``messageFormatter`` (a function) which allows for the creation of messages with unique content.

For example, if only short emails are desired (e.g., for delivery to phones)::

    from buildbot.plugins import reporters, util
    def messageFormatter(mode, name, build, results, master_status):
        result = util.Results[results]

        text = list()
        text.append("STATUS: %s" % result.title())
        return {
            'body' : "\n".join(text),
            'type' : 'plain'
        }

    mn = reporters.MailNotifier(fromaddr="buildbot@example.org",
                                sendToInterestedUsers=False,
                                mode=('problem',),
                                extraRecipients=['listaddr@example.org'],
                                messageFormatter=messageFormatter)

Another example of a function delivering a customized html email containing the last 80 log lines of logs of the last build step is given below::

    from buildbot.plugins import util, reporters

    import cgi, datetime

    # FIXME: this code is barely readable, we should provide a better example with use of jinja templates
    #
    def html_message_formatter(mode, name, build, results, master_status):
        """Provide a customized message to Buildbot's MailNotifier.

        The last 80 lines of the log are provided as well as the changes
        relevant to the build.  Message content is formatted as html.
        """
        result = util.Results[results]

        limit_lines = 80
        text = list()

MailNotifier arguments
++++++++++++++++++++++

``fromaddr``
    The email address to be used in the 'From' header.

``sendToInterestedUsers``
    (boolean).
    If ``True`` (the default), send mail to all of the Interested Users.
    If ``False``, only send mail to the ``extraRecipients`` list.

``extraRecipients``
    (list of strings).
    A list of email addresses to which messages should be sent (in addition to the InterestedUsers list, which includes any developers who made :class:`Change`\s that went into this build).
    It is a good idea to create a small mailing list and deliver to that, then let subscribers come and go as they please.

``subject``
    (string).
    A string to be used as the subject line of the message.
    ``%(builder)s`` will be replaced with the name of the builder which provoked the message.

``mode``
    Mode is a list of strings; however there are two strings which can be used as shortcuts instead of the full lists.
    The possible shortcuts are:

    ``all``
        Always send mail about builds.
        Equivalent to (``change``, ``failing``, ``passing``, ``problem``, ``warnings``, ``exception``).

    ``warnings``
        Equivalent to (``warnings``, ``failing``).

    (list of strings).
    A combination of:

    ``change``
        Send mail about builds which change status.

    ``failing``
        Send mail about builds which fail.

    ``passing``
        Send mail about builds which succeed.

    ``problem``
        Send mail about a build which failed when the previous build has passed.

    ``warnings``
        Send mail about builds which generate warnings.

    ``exception``
        Send mail about builds which generate exceptions.

    Defaults to (``failing``, ``passing``, ``warnings``).

``builders``
    (list of strings).
    A list of builder names for which mail should be sent.
    Defaults to ``None`` (send mail for all builds).
    Use either builders or tags, but not both.

``tags``
    (list of strings).
    A list of tag names to serve status information for.
    Defaults to ``None`` (all tags).
    Use either builders or tags, but not both.

``addLogs``
    (boolean).
    If ``True``, include all build logs as attachments to the messages.
    These can be quite large.
    This can also be set to a list of log names, to send a subset of the logs.
    Defaults to ``False``.

``addPatch``
    (boolean).
    If ``True``, include the patch content if a patch was present.
    Patches are usually used on a :class:`Try` server.
    Defaults to ``True``.

``buildSetSummary``
    (boolean).
    If ``True``, send a single summary email consisting of the concatenation of all build completion messages rather than a completion message for each build.
    Defaults to ``False``.

``relayhost``
    (string).
    The host to which the outbound SMTP connection should be made.
    Defaults to 'localhost'

``smtpPort``
    (int).
    The port that will be used on outbound SMTP connections.
    Defaults to 25.

``useTls``
    (boolean).
    When this argument is ``True`` (default is ``False``) ``MailNotifier`` sends emails using TLS and authenticates with the ``relayhost``.
    When using TLS the arguments ``smtpUser`` and ``smtpPassword`` must also be specified.

``smtpUser``
    (string).
    The user name to use when authenticating with the ``relayhost``.

``smtpPassword``
    (string).
    The password that will be used when authenticating with the ``relayhost``.

``lookup``
    (implementor of :class:`IEmailLookup`).
    Object which provides :class:`IEmailLookup`, which is responsible for mapping User names (which come from the VC system) into valid email addresses.

    If the argument is not provided, the ``MailNotifier`` will attempt to build the ``sendToInterestedUsers`` from the authors of the Changes that led to the Build via :ref:`User-Objects`.
    If the author of one of the Build's Changes has an email address stored, it will added to the recipients list.
    With this method, ``owners`` are still added to the recipients.
    Note that, in the current implementation of user objects, email addresses are not stored; as a result, unless you have specifically added email addresses to the user database, this functionality is unlikely to actually send any emails.

    Most of the time you can use a simple Domain instance.
    As a shortcut, you can pass as string: this will be treated as if you had provided ``Domain(str)``.
    For example, ``lookup='example.com'`` will allow mail to be sent to all developers whose SVN usernames match their ``example.com`` account names.
    See :file:`buildbot/reporters/mail.py` for more details.

    Regardless of the setting of ``lookup``, ``MailNotifier`` will also send mail to addresses in the ``extraRecipients`` list.

``messageFormatter``
    This is a optional function that can be used to generate a custom mail message.
    A :func:`messageFormatter` function takes the mail mode (``mode``), builder name (``name``), the build Data API results (``build``), the result code (``results``), and a reference to the BuildMaster object (``master``), which can then be used to create additional Data API calls.
    It returns a dictionary.
    The ``body`` key gives a string that is the complete text of the message.
    The ``type`` key is the message type ('plain' or 'html').
    The 'html' type should be used when generating an HTML message.
    The ``subject`` key is optional, but gives the subject for the email.

``extraHeaders``
    (dictionary).
    A dictionary containing key/value pairs of extra headers to add to sent e-mails.
    Both the keys and the values may be a `Interpolate` instance.


As a help to those writing :func:`messageFormatter` functions, the following table describes how to get some useful pieces of information from the various data objects:

Name of the builder that generated this event
    ``name``

Title of the BuildMaster
    ``master.config.title``

MailNotifier mode
    ``mode`` (a combination of ``change``, ``failing``, ``passing``, ``problem``, ``warnings``, ``exception``, ``all``)

Builder result as a string

    ::

        from buildbot.plugins import util
        result_str = util.Results[results]
        # one of 'success', 'warnings', 'failure', 'skipped', or 'exception'

URL to build page
    ``reporters.utils.getURLForBuild(master, build['buildid'])``

URL to buildbot main page
    ``master.config.buildbotURL``

Build text
    ``build['state_string']``

Mapping of property names to (values, source)
    ``build['properties']``

Slave name
    ``build['properties']['slavename']``

Build reason (from a forced build)
    ``build['properties']['reason']``

List of responsible users
    ``reporters.utils.getResponsibleUsersForBuild(master, build['buildid'])``

IRC Bot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The :bb:reporter:`IRC` status target creates an IRC bot which will attach to certain channels and be available for status queries.
It can also be asked to announce builds as they occur, or be told to shut up.

The IRC Bot in buildbot nine, is mostly a rewrite, and not all functionality has been ported yet.
Patches are very welcome for restoring the full functionality.

.. note:: Security Note

Please note that any user having access to your irc channel or can PM the bot will be able to create or stop builds :bug:`3377`.

    If provided, it will be sent to Nickserv to claim the nickname: some IRC servers will not allow clients to send private messages until they have logged in with a password.

``notify_events``
    (optional)
    A dictionary of events to be notified on the IRC channels.
    At the moment, irc bot can listen to build 'start' and 'finish' events.
    This parameter can be changed during run-time by sending the ``notify`` command to the bot.

``showBlameList``
    (optional, disabled by default)
    Whether or not to display the blame list for failed builds.
    (blame list functionality is not ported yet)

``useRevisions``
    (optional, disabled by default)
    Whether or not to display the revision leading to the build the messages are about.
    (useRevisions functionality is not ported yet)

``useSSL``
    (optional, disabled by default)
    Whether or not to use SSL when connecting to the IRC server.
    Note that this option requires `PyOpenSSL`_.

``lostDelay``
    (optional)
    Delay to wait before reconnecting to the server when the connection has been lost.

``failedDelay``
    (optional)
    Delay to wait before reconnecting to the IRC server when the connection failed.

``useColors``
    (optional, enabled by default)
    The bot can add color to some of its messages.
    You might turn it off by setting this parameter to ``False``.

``allowShutdown``
    (optional, disabled by default)
    This allow users to shutdown the master.


To use the service, you address messages at the Buildbot, either normally (``botnickname: status``) or with private messages (``/msg botnickname status``).
The Buildbot will respond in kind.

If you issue a command that is currently not available, the Buildbot will respond with an error message.
If the ``noticeOnChannel=True`` option was used, error messages will be sent as channel notices instead of messaging.

Some of the commands currently available:

``list builders``
    Emit a list of all configured builders

:samp:`status {BUILDER}`
    Announce the status of a specific Builder: what it is doing right now.

``status all``
    Announce the status of all Builders

:samp:`watch {BUILDER}`
    If the given :class:`Builder` is currently running, wait until the :class:`Build` is finished and then announce the results.

:samp:`last {BUILDER}`
    Return the results of the last build to run on the given :class:`Builder`.

:samp:`join {CHANNEL}`
    Join the given IRC channel

:samp:`leave {CHANNEL}`
    Leave the given IRC channel

:samp:`notify on|off|list {EVENT}`
    Report events relating to builds.
    If the command is issued as a private message, then the report will be sent back as a private message to the user who issued the command.
    Otherwise, the report will be sent to the channel.
    Available events to be notified are:

    ``started``
        A build has started

    ``finished``
        A build has finished

    ``success``
        A build finished successfully

    ``failure``
        A build failed

    ``exception``
        A build generated and exception

    ``xToY``
        The previous build was x, but this one is Y, where x and Y are each one of success, warnings, failure, exception (except Y is capitalized).
        For example: ``successToFailure`` will notify if the previous build was successful, but this one failed

:samp:`help {COMMAND}`
    Describe a command.
    Use :command:`help commands` to get a list of known commands.

:samp:`shutdown {ARG}`
    Control the shutdown process of the Buildbot master.
    Available arguments are:

    ``check``
        Check if the Buildbot master is running or shutting down

    ``start``
        Start clean shutdown

    ``stop``
        Stop clean shutdown

    ``now``
        Shutdown immediately without waiting for the builders to finish

``source``
    Announce the URL of the Buildbot's home page.

``version``
    Announce the version of this Buildbot.

Additionally, the config file may specify default notification options as shown in the example earlier.

If the ``allowForce=True`` option was used, some additional commands will be available:

.. index:: Properties; from forced build

:samp:`force build [--codebase={CODEBASE}] [--branch={BRANCH}] [--revision={REVISION}] [--props=PROP1=VAL1,PROP2=VAL2...] {BUILDER} {REASON}`
    Tell the given :class:`Builder` to start a build of the latest code.
    The user requesting the build and *REASON* are recorded in the :class:`Build` status.
    The Buildbot will announce the build's status when it finishes.The user can specify a branch and/or revision with the optional parameters :samp:`--branch={BRANCH}` and :samp:`--revision={REVISION}`.
    The user can also give a list of properties with :samp:`--props={PROP1=VAL1,PROP2=VAL2..}`.

:samp:`stop build {BUILDER} {REASON}`
    Terminate any running build in the given :class:`Builder`.
    *REASON* will be added to the build status to explain why it was stopped.
    You might use this if you committed a bug, corrected it right away, and don't want to wait for the first build (which is destined to fail) to complete before starting the second (hopefully fixed) build.

If the `tags` is set (see the tags option in :ref:`Builder-Configuration`) changes related to only builders belonging to those tags of builders will be sent to the channel.

If the `useRevisions` option is set to `True`, the IRC bot will send status messages that replace the build number with a list of revisions that are contained in that build.
So instead of seeing `build #253 of ...`, you would see something like `build containing revisions [a87b2c4]`.
Revisions that are stored as hashes are shortened to 7 characters in length, as multiple revisions can be contained in one build and may exceed the IRC message length limit.

Two additional arguments can be set to control how fast the IRC bot tries to reconnect when it encounters connection issues.
``lostDelay`` is the number of of seconds the bot will wait to reconnect when the connection is lost, where as ``failedDelay`` is the number of seconds until the bot tries to reconnect when the connection failed.
``lostDelay`` defaults to a random number between 1 and 5, while ``failedDelay`` defaults to a random one between 45 and 60.
Setting random defaults like this means multiple IRC bots are less likely to deny each other by flooding the server.

    from buildbot.plugins import status
    sp = status.StatusPush(serverPushCb=Process, bufferDelay=0.5, retryDelay=5)
    c['services'].append(sp)

:class:`StatusPush` batches events normally processed and sends it to the :func:`serverPushCb` callback every ``bufferDelay`` seconds.
The callback should pop items from the queue and then queue the next callback.
If no items were popped from ``self.queue``, ``retryDelay`` seconds will be waited instead.

:class:`HttpStatusPush` builds on :class:`StatusPush` and sends HTTP requests to ``serverUrl``, with all the items json-encoded.
It is useful to create a status front end outside of Buildbot for better scalability.

.. bb:reporter:: GerritStatusPush

GerritStatusPush
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. py:class:: buildbot.status.status_gerrit.GerritStatusPush

:class:`GerritStatusPush` sends review of the :class:`Change` back to the Gerrit server, optionally also sending a message when a build is started.
GerritStatusPush can send a separate review for each build that completes, or a single review summarizing the results for all of the builds.

.. py:class:: GerritStatusPush(server, username, reviewCB, startCB, port, reviewArg, startArg, summaryCB, summaryArg, identity_file, ...)

   :param string server: Gerrit SSH server's address to use for push event notifications.
   :param string username: Gerrit SSH server's username.
   :param identity_file: (optional) Gerrit SSH identity file.
   :param int port: (optional) Gerrit SSH server's port (default: 29418)
   :param reviewCB: (optional) callback that is called each time a build is finished, and that is used to define the message and review approvals depending on the build result.
   :param reviewArg: (optional) argument passed to the review callback.

                    If :py:func:`reviewCB` callback is specified, it determines the message and score to give when sending a review for each separate build.
                    It should return a dictionary:

                    .. code-block:: python

                        {'message': message,
                         'labels': {label-name: label-score,
                                    ...}
                        }

                    For example:

                    .. literalinclude:: /examples/git_gerrit.cfg
                       :pyobject: gerritReviewCB
                       :language: python

                    Which require an extra import in the config:

                    .. code-block:: python

                       from buildbot.plugins import util

   :param startCB: (optional) callback that is called each time a build is started.
                   Used to define the message sent to Gerrit.
   :param startArg: (optional) argument passed to the start callback.

                    If :py:func:`startCB` is specified, it should return a message.
                    This message will be sent to the Gerrit server when each build is started, for example:

                    .. literalinclude:: /examples/git_gerrit.cfg
                       :pyobject: gerritStartCB

   :param summaryCB: (optional) callback that is called each time a buildset finishes, and that is used to define a message and review approvals depending on the build result.
   :param summaryArg: (optional) argument passed to the summary callback.

                      If :py:func:`summaryCB` callback is specified, determines the message and score to give when sending a single review summarizing all of the builds.
                      It should return a dictionary:

                      .. code-block:: python

                          {'message': message,
                           'labels': {label-name: label-score,
                                      ...}
                          }

                      .. literalinclude:: /examples/git_gerrit.cfg
                         :pyobject: gerritSummaryCB

   :param builders: (optional) list of builders to send results for.
                    This method allows to filter results for a specific set of builder.
                    By default, or if builders is None, then no filtering is performed.

.. note::

   By default, a single summary review is sent; that is, a default :py:func:`summaryCB` is provided, but no :py:func:`reviewCB` or :py:func:`startCB`.

.. note::

   If :py:func:`reviewCB` or :py:func:`summaryCB` do not return any labels, only a message will be pushed to the Gerrit server.

.. seealso::

   :file:`master/docs/examples/git_gerrit.cfg` and :file:`master/docs/examples/repo_gerrit.cfg` in the Buildbot distribution provide a full example setup of Git+Gerrit or Repo+Gerrit of :bb:reporter:`GerritStatusPush`.

:class:`GitHubStatus` publishes a build status using `GitHub Status API <http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses>`_.

It requires `txgithub <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/txgithub>` package to allow interaction with GitHub API.

It is configured with at least a GitHub API token, repoOwner and repoName arguments.

You can create a token from you own `GitHub - Profile - Applications - Register new application <https://github.com/settings/applications>`_ or use an external tool to generate one.

`repoOwner`, `repoName` are used to inform the plugin where to send status for build.
This allow using a single :class:`GitHubStatus` for multiple projects.
`repoOwner`, `repoName` can be passes as a static `string` (for single project) or :class:`Interpolate` for dynamic substitution in multiple project.

`sha` argument is use to define the commit SHA for which to send the status.
By default `sha` is defined as: `%(src::revision)s`.

In case any of `repoOwner`, `repoName` or `sha` returns `None`, `False` or empty string, the plugin will skip sending the status.

The `context` argument is passed to GitHub to differentiate between statuses. A static string can be passed or :class:`Interpolate` for dynamic substitution.
The default context is `buildbot/%(prop:buildername)s`.

You can define custom start and end build messages using the `startDescription` and `endDescription` optional interpolation arguments.

Starting with Buildbot version 0.8.11, :class:`GitHubStatus` supports additional parameter -- ``baseURL`` -- that allows to specify a different API base endpoint.
This is required if you work with GitHub Enterprise installation.
This feature requires ``txgithub`` of version 0.2.0 or better.

:class:`StashStatusPush` publishes build status using `Stash Build Integration REST API <https://developer.atlassian.com/static/rest/stash/3.6.0/stash-build-integration-rest.html>`_.
The build status is published to a specific commit SHA in Stash.
It tracks the last build for each builderName for each commit built.

Specifically, it follows the `Updating build status for commits <https://developer.atlassian.com/stash/docs/latest/how-tos/updating-build-status-for-commits.html>`_ document.

It uses the standard Python Twisted Agent to make REST requests to the stash server.
It uses HTTP Basic AUTH.
As a result, we recommend you use https in your base_url rather than http.
If you use https, it requires `pyOpenSSL`.

Configuration requires exactly 3 parameters:

``base_url``
    the base url of the stash host, up to and optionally including the first `/` of the path.
``user``
    the stash user to post as
``password``
    the stash user's password
