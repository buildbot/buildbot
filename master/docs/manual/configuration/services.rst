Custom Services
---------------

For advanced users or plugin writers, the ``services`` key is available, and holds a list of :py:class:`buildbot.util.service.BuildbotService`.
As this is a feature for advanced users, it is described in the developer section of the manual.

This section will grow as soon as ready-to-use services are created.
