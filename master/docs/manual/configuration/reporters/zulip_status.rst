:class:`ZulipStatusPush` sends build status using `The Zulip API <https://zulipchat.com/api/>`_.
The build status is sent to a user as a private message or in a stream in Zulip.

.. py:class:: ZulipStatusPush(endpoint, token, stream=None, generators=None)

    :param string endpoint: URL of your Zulip server
    :param string token: Private API token
    :param string stream: The stream in which the build status is to be sent. Defaults to None
    :type generators: list of IReportGenerator instances
    :param generators: A list of report generators that will be used to generate reports to be sent by this reporter.
        Currently the reporter will consider only the report generated by the first generator.


.. note::

   A private message is sent if stream is set to None.
