:class:`GitLabStatusPush` publishes build status using `GitLab Commit Status API <http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/api/commits.html#commit-status>`_.
The build status is published to a specific commit SHA in GitLab.

It requires `txrequests`_ package to allow interaction with GitLab Commit Status API.

It uses private token auth, and the token owner is required to have at least developer access to each repository. As a result, we recommend you use https in your base_url rather than http.
