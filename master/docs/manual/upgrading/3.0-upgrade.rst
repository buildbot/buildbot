.. _3.0_Upgrading:

Upgrading to Buildbot 3.0 (not released yet)
============================================

Upgrading a Buildbot instance from 2.x to 3.0 may require some work to achieve.

The recommended upgrade procedure is as follows:

  - Upgrade to the last released BuildBot version in 2.x series.

  - Remove usage of the deprecated APIs.
    All usages of deprecated APIs threw a deprecation warning at the point of use.
    If the code does not emit deprecation warnings, it's in a good shape in this regard.
    You may need to run the master on a real workload in order to force all deprecated code paths to be exercised.

  - Upgrade to Buildbot 3.0.

  - Fix all usages of deprecated APIs.
    In this case, the only deprecated APIs are temporary ``*NewStyle`` build step aliases.

  - (Optional) Upgrade to newest Buildbot 3.x.
    The newest point release will contain bug fixes and functionality improvements.

Build steps
-----------

Buildbot 3.0 no longer supports old-style steps (steps which implement ``start`` method as opposed to ``run`` method).
This only affects users who use steps as base classes for their own steps.
New style steps provide a completely different set of functions that may be overridden.
Direct instantiation of step classes is not affected.
Old and new style steps work exactly the same in that case and users don't need to do anything.

See :ref:`New-Style-Build-Steps` for instructions of migration to new-style steps.

Migrating build steps that subclass one of the build steps provided by Buildbot is a little bit more involved.
The new and old-style step APIs cannot be provided by a single class.
Therefore Buildbot 2.9 introduces a number of new-style build steps that are direct equivalent of their old-style counterparts.
These build steps are named as ``<StepType>NewStyle`` where ``<StepType>`` is the old-style step they provide compatibility interface for.
Buildbot 3.0 removes old-style step support and changes the ``<StepType>`` classes to be equivalent to ``<StepType>NewStyle`` counterparts.
Buildbot 3.2 removes the ``<StepType>NewStyle`` aliases.

If a custom step is a subclass of ``<StepType`` step which is provided by Buildbot, then the migration process is as follows.
The custom step should be changed to subclass the ``<StepType>NewStyle`` equivalent and use the new-style APIs as specified in :ref:`New-Style-Build-Steps`.
This part of the migration must be done before the build master is migrated to 3.0.
The resulting custom step will work in Buildbot 2.9.x-3.1.x.
After the build master is migrated to 3.0, the custom step may be changed to subclass ``<StepType``.
This is a simple renaming change, no other related changes are necessary.
This part of the migration must be done before the build master is migrated to 3.2.

The following build steps have their new-style equivalents since Buildbot 2.9:

The list of old-style steps that have new-style equivalents for gradual migration is as follows:

 - ``Configure`` (new-style equivalent is ``ConfigureNewStyle``)
 - ``Compile`` (new-style equivalent is ``CompileNewStyle``)
 - ``HTTPStep`` (new-style equivalent is ``HTTPStepNewStyle``)
 - ``GET``, ``PUT``, ``POST``, ``DELETE``, ``HEAD``, ``OPTIONS`` (new-style equivalent is ``GETNewStyle``, ``PUTNewStyle``, ``POSTNewStyle``, ``DELETENewStyle``, ``HEADNewStyle``, ``OPTIONSNewStyle``)
 - ``MasterShellCommand`` (new-style equivalent is ``MasterShellCommandNewStyle``)
 - ``ShellCommand`` (new-style equivalent is ``ShellCommandNewStyle``)
 - ``SetPropertyFromCommand`` (new-style equivalent is ``SetPropertyFromCommandNewStyle``)
 - ``WarningCountingShellCommand`` (new-style equivalent is ``WarningCountingShellCommandNewStyle``)
 - ``Test`` (new-style equivalent is ``TestNewStyle``)

The migration path of all other steps is more involved as no compatibility steps are provided.

Reporters and report generators
-------------------------------

Buildbot 2.9 introduced report generators as the preferred way of configuring the conditions of when a message is sent by a reporter and contents of the messages.
The old parameters have been deprecated in Buildbot 2.9 and removed in Buildbot 3.0.

The following describes the procedure of upgrading reporters.

In general, one or more arguments to a reporter is going to be replaced by a list of one or more report generators passed as a list to the ``generators`` parameter.

The description below will explain what to do with each parameter.

MailNotifier
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``generators`` list will contain one or two report generators.

The first will be an instance of :bb:reportgen:`BuildStatusGenerator` if the value of ``buildSetSummary`` was ``True`` or :bb:reportgen:`BuildSetStatusGenerator` if the value of ``buildSetSummary`` was ``False``.
This will be referred to as *status generator* in the description below.

The second generator is optional.
It included if the value of ``watchedWorkers`` is not ``None`` (the default is ``"all"``)
If included, it's an instance of :bb:reportgen:`WorkerMissingGenerator`.
This will be referred to as *missing worker generator* in the description below.

The following arguments have been removed:

* ``subject``. Replacement is ``subject`` parameter of the *status generator*.

* ``mode``. Replacement is ``mode`` parameter of the *status generator*.

* ``builders``. Replacement is ``builders`` parameter of the *status generator*.

* ``tags``. Replacement is ``tags`` parameter of the *status generator*.

* ``schedulers``. Replacement is ``schedulers`` parameter of the *status generator*.

* ``branches``. Replacement is ``branches`` parameter of the *status generator*.

* ``addLogs``. Replacement is ``add_logs`` parameter of the *status generator*.

* ``addPatch``. Replacement is ``add_patch`` parameter of the *status generator*.

* ``buildSetSummary``. Defines whether the *status generator* will be instance of :bb:reportgen:`BuildStatusGenerator` (value of ``True``, the default) or :bb:reportgen:`BuildSetStatusGenerator` (value of ``False``).

* ``messageFormatter``. Replacement is ``message_formatter`` parameter of the *status generator*.

* ``watchedWorkers``. Replacement is ``workers`` parameter of the *missing worker generator*.
  If the value was ``None``, then there's no *missing worker generator* and the value of ``messageFormatterMissingWorker`` is ignored.

* ``messageFormatterMissingWorker``. Replacement is ``message_formatter`` parameter of the *missing worker generator*.

PushjetNotifier, PushoverNotifier, BitbucketServerPRCommentPush
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``generators`` list will contain one or two report generators.

The first will be an instance of :bb:reportgen:`BuildStatusGenerator` if the value of ``buildSetSummary`` was ``True`` or :bb:reportgen:`BuildSetStatusGenerator` if the value of ``buildSetSummary`` was ``False``.
This will be referred to as *status generator* in the description below.

The second generator is optional.
It included if the value of ``watchedWorkers`` is not ``None`` (the default is ``None``)
If included, it's an instance of :bb:reportgen:`WorkerMissingGenerator`.
This will be referred to as *missing worker generator* in the description below.

The following arguments have been removed:

* ``subject``. Replacement is ``subject`` parameter of the *status generator*.

* ``mode``. Replacement is ``mode`` parameter of the *status generator*.

* ``builders``. Replacement is ``builders`` parameter of the *status generator*.

* ``tags``. Replacement is ``tags`` parameter of the *status generator*.

* ``schedulers``. Replacement is ``schedulers`` parameter of the *status generator*.

* ``branches``. Replacement is ``branches`` parameter of the *status generator*.

* ``buildSetSummary``. Defines whether the *status generator* will be instance of :bb:reportgen:`BuildStatusGenerator` (value of ``True``, the default) or :bb:reportgen:`BuildSetStatusGenerator` (value of ``False``).

* ``messageFormatter``. Replacement is ``message_formatter`` parameter of the *status generator*.
  In the case of ``PushjetNotifier`` and ``PushoverNotifier``, the default message formatter is ``DefaultMessageFormatter(template_type='html', template_filename='default_notification.txt')``.

* ``watchedWorkers``. Replacement is ``workers`` parameter of the *missing worker generator*.
  If the value was ``None``, then there's no *missing worker generator* and the value of ``messageFormatterMissingWorker`` is ignored.

* ``messageFormatterMissingWorker``. Replacement is ``message_formatter`` parameter of the *missing worker generator*.
  In the case of ``PushjetNotifier`` and ``PushoverNotifier``, the default message formatter is ``MessageFormatterMissingWorker(template_filename='missing_notification.txt')``.
