.. _Customization:

Customization
=============

For advanced users, Buildbot acts as a framework supporting a customized build
application.  For the most part, such configurations consist of subclasses set
up for use in a regular Buildbot configuration file.

This chapter describes some of the more common idioms in advanced Buildbot
configurations.

At the moment, this chapter is an unordered set of suggestions; if you'd like
to clean it up, fork the project on github and get started!

Programmatic Configuration Generation
-------------------------------------

Bearing in mind that ``master.cfg`` is a Python file, large configurations can
be shortened considerably by judicious use of Python loops.  For example, the
following will generate a builder for each of a range of supported versions of
Python::

    pythons = [ 'python2.4', 'python2.5', 'python2.6', 'python2.7',
                'python3.2', python3.3' ]
    pytest_slaves = [ "slave%s" % n for n in range(10) ]
    for python in pythons:
        f = BuildFactory()
        f.addStep(SVN(..))
        f.addStep(ShellCommand(command=[ python, 'test.py' ]))
        c['builders'].append(BuilderConfig(
                name="test-%s" % python,
                factory=f,
                slavenames=pytest_slaves))

.. _Merge-Request-Functions:

Merge Request Functions
-----------------------

.. index:: Builds; merging

The logic Buildbot uses to decide which build request can be merged can be
customized by providing a Python function (a callable) instead of ``True`` or
``False`` described in :ref:`Merging-Build-Requests`.

The callable will be invoked with three positional arguments: a
:class:`Builder` object and two :class:`BuildRequest` objects. It should return
true if the requests can be merged, and False otherwise. For example::

    def mergeRequests(builder, req1, req2):
        "any requests with the same branch can be merged"
        return req1.branch == req2.branch
    c['mergeRequests'] = mergeRequests

In many cases, the details of the :class:`SourceStamp`\s and :class:`BuildRequest`\s are important.
In this example, only :class:`BuildRequest`\s with the same "reason" are merged; thus
developers forcing builds for different reasons will see distinct builds.  Note
the use of the :func:`canBeMergedWith` method to access the source stamp
compatibility algorithm. ::

    def mergeRequests(builder, req1, req2):
        if req1.source.canBeMergedWith(req2.source) and  req1.reason == req2.reason:
           return True
        return False
    c['mergeRequests'] = mergeRequests

If it's necessary to perform some extended operation to determine whether two
requests can be merged, then the ``mergeRequests`` callable may return its
result via Deferred.  Note, however, that the number of invocations of the
callable is proportional to the square of the request queue length, so a
long-running callable may cause undesirable delays when the queue length
grows.  For example::

    def mergeRequests(builder, req1, req2):
        d = defer.gatherResults([
            getMergeInfo(req1.source.revision),
            getMergeInfo(req2.source.revision),
        ])
        def process(info1, info2):
            return info1 == info2
        d.addCallback(process)
        return d
    c['mergeRequests'] = mergeRequests

.. _Builder-Priority-Functions:

Builder Priority Functions
--------------------------

.. index:: Builders; priority

The :bb:cfg:`prioritizeBuilders` configuration key specifies a function which
is called with two arguments: a :class:`BuildMaster` and a list of
:class:`Builder` objects.  It should return a list of the same :class:`Builder`
objects, in the desired order.  It may also remove items from the list if
builds should not be started on those builders. If necessary, this function can
return its results via a Deferred (it is called with ``maybeDeferred``).

A simple ``prioritizeBuilders`` implementation might look like this::

    def prioritizeBuilders(buildmaster, builders):
        """Prioritize builders.  'finalRelease' builds have the highest
        priority, so they should be built before running tests, or
        creating builds."""
        builderPriorities = {
            "finalRelease": 0,
            "test": 1,
            "build": 2,
        }
        builders.sort(key=lambda b: builderPriorities.get(b.name, 0))
        return builders

    c['prioritizeBuilders'] = prioritizeBuilders

.. index:: Builds; priority

.. _Build-Priority-Functions:

Build Priority Functions
------------------------

When a builder has multiple pending build requests, it uses a ``nextBuild``
function to decide which build it should start first.  This function is given
two parameters: the :class:`Builder`, and a list of :class:`BuildRequest`
objects representing pending build requests.

A simple function to prioritize release builds over other builds might look
like this::

   def nextBuild(bldr, requests):
       for r in requests:
           if r.source.branch == 'release':
               return r
       return requests[0]

If some non-immediate result must be calculated, the ``nextBuild`` function can
also return a Deferred::

    def nextBuild(bldr, requests):
        d = get_request_priorities(requests)
        def pick(priorities):
            if requests:
                return sorted(zip(priorities, requests))[0][1]
        d.addCallback(pick)
        return d

.. _Customizing-SVNPoller:

Customizing SVNPoller
---------------------

Each source file that is tracked by a Subversion repository has a
fully-qualified SVN URL in the following form:
``({REPOURL})({PROJECT-plus-BRANCH})({FILEPATH})``. When you create the
:bb:chsrc:`SVNPoller`, you give it a ``svnurl`` value that includes all of the
``{REPOURL}`` and possibly some portion of the
``{PROJECT-plus-BRANCH}`` string. The :bb:chsrc:`SVNPoller` is responsible
for producing Changes that contain a branch name and a ``{FILEPATH}``
(which is relative to the top of a checked-out tree). The details of how these
strings are split up depend upon how your repository names its branches.

PROJECT/BRANCHNAME/FILEPATH repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One common layout is to have all the various projects that share a repository
get a single top-level directory each, with ``branches``, ``tags``, and
``trunk`` subdirectories:

.. code-block:: none

    amanda/trunk
          /branches/3_2
                   /3_3
          /tags/3_2_1
               /3_2_2
               /3_3_0

To set up a :bb:chsrc:`SVNPoller` that watches the Amanda trunk (and nothing
else), we would use the following, using the default ``split_file``::

    from buildbot.changes.svnpoller import SVNPoller
    c['change_source'] = SVNPoller(
       svnurl="https://svn.amanda.sourceforge.net/svnroot/amanda/amanda/trunk")

In this case, every Change that our :bb:chsrc:`SVNPoller` produces will have
its branch attribute set to ``None``, to indicate that the Change is on the
trunk.  No other sub-projects or branches will be tracked.

If we want our ChangeSource to follow multiple branches, we have to do
two things. First we have to change our ``svnurl=`` argument to
watch more than just ``amanda/trunk``. We will set it to
``amanda`` so that we'll see both the trunk and all the branches.
Second, we have to tell :bb:chsrc:`SVNPoller` how to split the
``({PROJECT-plus-BRANCH})({FILEPATH})`` strings it gets from the repository
out into ``({BRANCH})`` and ``({FILEPATH})```.

We do the latter by providing a ``split_file`` function. This function is
responsible for splitting something like ``branches/3_3/common-src/amanda.h``
into ``branch='branches/3_3'`` and ``filepath='common-src/amanda.h'``. The
function is always given a string that names a file relative to the
subdirectory pointed to by the :bb:chsrc:`SVNPoller`\'s ``svnurl=`` argument.
It is expected to return a dictionary with at least the ``path`` key. The
splitter may optionally set ``branch``, ``project`` and ``repository``.
For backwards compatibility it may return a tuple of ``(branchname, path)``.
It may also return ``None`` to indicate that the file is of no interest.

.. note:: the function should return ``branches/3_3`` rather than just ``3_3``
    because the SVN checkout step, will append the branch name to the
    ``baseURL``, which requires that we keep the ``branches`` component in
    there. Other VC schemes use a different approach towards branches and may
    not require this artifact.

If your repository uses this same ``{PROJECT}/{BRANCH}/{FILEPATH}`` naming
scheme, the following function will work::

    def split_file_branches(path):
        pieces = path.split('/')
        if len(pieces) > 1 and pieces[0] == 'trunk':
            return (None, '/'.join(pieces[1:]))
        elif len(pieces) > 2 and pieces[0] == 'branches':
            return ('/'.join(pieces[0:2]),
                    '/'.join(pieces[2:]))
        else:
            return None

In fact, this is the definition of the provided ``split_file_branches``
function.  So to have our Twisted-watching :bb:chsrc:`SVNPoller` follow
multiple branches, we would use this::

    from buildbot.changes.svnpoller import SVNPoller, split_file_branches
    c['change_source'] = SVNPoller("svn://svn.twistedmatrix.com/svn/Twisted",
                                   split_file=split_file_branches)

Changes for all sorts of branches (with names like ``"branches/1.5.x"``, and
``None`` to indicate the trunk) will be delivered to the Schedulers.  Each
Scheduler is then free to use or ignore each branch as it sees fit.

If you have multiple projects in the same repository your split function can
attach a project name to the Change to help the Scheduler filter out unwanted
changes::

    from buildbot.changes.svnpoller import split_file_branches
    def split_file_projects_branches(path):
        if not "/" in path:
            return None
        project, path = path.split("/", 1)
        f = split_file_branches(path)
        if f:
            info = dict(project=project, path=f[1])
            if f[0]:
                info['branch'] = f[0]
            return info
        return f

Again, this is provided by default. To use it you would do this::

    from buildbot.changes.svnpoller import SVNPoller, split_file_projects_branches
    c['change_source'] = SVNPoller(
       svnurl="https://svn.amanda.sourceforge.net/svnroot/amanda/",
       split_file=split_file_projects_branches)

Note here that we are monitoring at the root of the repository, and that within
that repository is a ``amanda`` subdirectory which in turn has ``trunk`` and
``branches``. It is that ``amanda`` subdirectory whose name becomes the
``project`` field of the Change.


BRANCHNAME/PROJECT/FILEPATH repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another common way to organize a Subversion repository is to put the branch
name at the top, and the projects underneath. This is especially frequent when
there are a number of related sub-projects that all get released in a group.

For example, `Divmod.org <http://Divmod.org>`_ hosts a project named `Nevow` as
well as one named `Quotient`. In a checked-out Nevow tree there is a directory
named `formless` that contains a python source file named :file:`webform.py`.
This repository is accessible via webdav (and thus uses an `http:` scheme)
through the divmod.org hostname. There are many branches in this repository,
and they use a ``({BRANCHNAME})/({PROJECT})`` naming policy.

The fully-qualified SVN URL for the trunk version of :file:`webform.py` is
``http://divmod.org/svn/Divmod/trunk/Nevow/formless/webform.py``.
The 1.5.x branch version of this file would have a URL of
``http://divmod.org/svn/Divmod/branches/1.5.x/Nevow/formless/webform.py``.
The whole Nevow trunk would be checked out with
``http://divmod.org/svn/Divmod/trunk/Nevow``, while the Quotient
trunk would be checked out using
``http://divmod.org/svn/Divmod/trunk/Quotient``.

Now suppose we want to have an :bb:chsrc:`SVNPoller` that only cares about the
Nevow trunk. This case looks just like the ``{PROJECT}/{BRANCH}`` layout
described earlier::

    from buildbot.changes.svnpoller import SVNPoller
    c['change_source'] = SVNPoller("http://divmod.org/svn/Divmod/trunk/Nevow")

But what happens when we want to track multiple Nevow branches? We
have to point our ``svnurl=`` high enough to see all those
branches, but we also don't want to include Quotient changes (since
we're only building Nevow). To accomplish this, we must rely upon the
``split_file`` function to help us tell the difference between
files that belong to Nevow and those that belong to Quotient, as well
as figuring out which branch each one is on. ::

    from buildbot.changes.svnpoller import SVNPoller
    c['change_source'] = SVNPoller("http://divmod.org/svn/Divmod",
                                   split_file=my_file_splitter)

The ``my_file_splitter`` function will be called with repository-relative
pathnames like:

:file:`trunk/Nevow/formless/webform.py`
    This is a Nevow file, on the trunk. We want the Change that includes this
    to see a filename of :file:`formless/webform.py`, and a branch of
    ``None``

:file:`branches/1.5.x/Nevow/formless/webform.py`
    This is a Nevow file, on a branch. We want to get
    ``branch='branches/1.5.x'`` and ``filename='formless/webform.py'``.

:file:`trunk/Quotient/setup.py`
    This is a Quotient file, so we want to ignore it by having
    :meth:`my_file_splitter` return ``None``.

:file:`branches/1.5.x/Quotient/setup.py`
    This is also a Quotient file, which should be ignored.

The following definition for :meth:`my_file_splitter` will do the job::

    def my_file_splitter(path):
        pieces = path.split('/')
        if pieces[0] == 'trunk':
            branch = None
            pieces.pop(0) # remove 'trunk'
        elif pieces[0] == 'branches':
            pieces.pop(0) # remove 'branches'
            # grab branch name
            branch = 'branches/' + pieces.pop(0)
        else:
            return None # something weird
        projectname = pieces.pop(0)
        if projectname != 'Nevow':
            return None # wrong project
        return dict(branc=branch, path='/'.join(pieces))

If you later decide you want to get changes for Quotient as well you could
replace the last 3 lines with simply::

    return dict(project=projectname, branch=branch, path='/'.join(pieces))


.. _Writing-Change-Sources:

Writing Change Sources
----------------------

For some version-control systems, making Bulidbot aware of new changes can be a
challenge.  If the pre-supplied classes in :ref:`Change-Sources` are not
sufficient, then you will need to write your own.

There are three approaches, one of which is not even a change source.
The first option is to write a change source that exposes some service to
which the version control system can "push" changes.  This can be more
complicated, since it requires implementing a new service, but delivers changes
to Buildbot immediately on commit.

The second option is often preferable to the first: implement a notification
service in an external process (perhaps one that is started directly by the
version control system, or by an email server) and delivers changes to Buildbot
via :ref:`PBChangeSource`.  This section does not describe this particular
approach, since it requires no customization within the buildmaster process.

The third option is to write a change source which polls for changes -
repeatedly connecting to an external service to check for new changes.  This
works well in many cases, but can produce a high load on the version control
system if polling is too frequent, and can take too long to notice changes if
the polling is not frequent enough.

Writing a Notification-based Change Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. py:class:: buildbot.changes.base.ChangeSource

A custom change source must implement
:class:`buildbot.interfaces.IChangeSource`.

The easiest way to do this is to subclass
:class:`buildbot.changes.base.ChangeSource`, implementing the :meth:`describe`
method to describe the instance. :class:`ChangeSource` is a Twisted service, so
you will need to implement the :meth:`startService` and :meth:`stopService`
methods to control the means by which your change source receives
notifications.

When the class does receive a change, it should call
``self.master.addChange(..)`` to submit it to the buildmaster.  This method
shares the same parameters as ``master.db.changes.addChange``, so consult the
API documentation for that function for details on the available arguments.

You will probably also want to set ``compare_attrs`` to the list of object
attributes which Buildbot will use to compare one change source to another when
reconfiguring.  During reconfiguration, if the new change source is different
from the old, then the old will be stopped and the new started.

Writing a Change Poller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. py:class:: buildbot.changes.base.PollingChangeSource

Polling is a very common means of seeking changes, so Buildbot supplies a
utility parent class to make it easier.  A poller should subclass
:class:`buildbot.changes.base.PollingChangeSource`, which is a subclass of
:class:`ChangeSource`.  This subclass implements the :meth:`Service` methods,
and causes the :meth:`poll` method to be called every ``self.pollInterval``
seconds.  This method should return a Deferred to signal its completion.

Aside from the service methods, the other concerns in the previous section
apply here, too.

Writing a New Latent Buildslave Implementation
----------------------------------------------

Writing a new latent buildslave should only require subclassing
:class:`buildbot.buildslave.AbstractLatentBuildSlave` and implementing
:meth:`start_instance` and :meth:`stop_instance`. ::

    def start_instance(self):
        # responsible for starting instance that will try to connect with this
        # master. Should return deferred. Problems should use an errback. The
        # callback value can be None, or can be an iterable of short strings to
        # include in the "substantiate success" status message, such as
        # identifying the instance that started.
        raise NotImplementedError
    
    def stop_instance(self, fast=False):
        # responsible for shutting down instance. Return a deferred. If `fast`,
        # we're trying to shut the master down, so callback as soon as is safe.
        # Callback value is ignored.
        raise NotImplementedError

See :class:`buildbot.ec2buildslave.EC2LatentBuildSlave` for an example, or see
the test example :class:`buildbot.test_slaves.FakeLatentBuildSlave`.

Custom Build Classes
--------------------

The standard :class:`BuildFactory` object creates :class:`Build` objects
by default. These Builds will each execute a collection of :class:`BuildStep`\s
in a fixed sequence. Each step can affect the results of the build,
but in general there is little intelligence to tie the different steps
together. 

By setting the factory's ``buildClass`` attribute to a different class, you can
instantiate a different build class.  This might be useful, for example, to
create a build class that dynamically determines which steps to run.  The
skeleton of such a project would look like::

    class DynamicBuild(Build):
        # .. override some methods

    f = factory.BuildFactory()
    f.buildClass = DynamicBuild
    f.addStep(...)

.. _Factory-Workdir-Functions:

Factory Workdir Functions
-------------------------

It is sometimes helpful to have a build's workdir determined at runtime based
on the parameters of the build.  To accomplish this, set the ``workdir``
attribute of the build factory to a callable.  That callable will be invoked
with the :class:`SourceStamp` for the build, and should return the appropriate
workdir.  Note that the value must be returned immediately - Deferreds are not
supported.

This can be useful, for exmaple, in scenarios with multiple repositories
submitting changes to BuildBot. In this case you likely will want to have a
dedicated workdir per repository, since otherwise a sourcing step with mode =
"update" will fail as a workdir with a working copy of repository A can't be
"updated" for changes from a repository B. Here is an example how you can
achive workdir-per-repo::

        def workdir(source_stamp):
            return hashlib.md5 (source_stamp.repository).hexdigest()[:8]

        build_factory = factory.BuildFactory()
        build_factory.workdir = workdir

        build_factory.addStep(Git(mode="update"))
        # ...
        builders.append ({'name': 'mybuilder',
                          'slavename': 'myslave',
                          'builddir': 'mybuilder',
                          'factory': build_factory})

The end result is a set of workdirs like

.. code-block:: none

    Repo1 => <buildslave-base>/mybuilder/a78890ba
    Repo2 => <buildslave-base>/mybuilder/0823ba88

You could make the :func:`workdir()` function compute other paths, based on
parts of the repo URL in the sourcestamp, or lookup in a lookup table
based on repo URL. As long as there is a permanent 1:1 mapping between
repos and workdir, this will work.

Writing New BuildSteps
----------------------

While it is a good idea to keep your build process self-contained in the source code tree, sometimes it is convenient to put more intelligence into your Buildbot configuration.
One way to do this is to write a custom :class:`BuildStep`.
Once written, this Step can be used in the :file:`master.cfg` file.

The best reason for writing a custom :class:`BuildStep` is to better parse the results of the command being run.
For example, a :class:`BuildStep` that knows about JUnit could look at the logfiles to determine which tests had been run, how many passed and how many failed, and then report more detailed information than a simple ``rc==0`` -based `good/bad` decision.

Buildbot has acquired a large fleet of build steps, and sports a number of knobs and hooks to make steps easier to write.
This section may seem a bit overwhelming, but most custom steps will only need to apply one or two of the techniques outlined here.

For complete documentation of the build step interfaces, see :doc:`../developer/cls-buildsteps`.

.. _Writing-BuildStep-Constructors:

Writing BuildStep Constructors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build steps act as their own factories, so their constructors are a bit more complex than necessary.
In the configuration file, a :class:`~buildbot.process.buildstep.BuildStep` object is instantiated, but because steps store state locally while executing, this object cannot be used during builds.

Consider the use of a :class:`BuildStep` in :file:`master.cfg`::

    f.addStep(MyStep(someopt="stuff", anotheropt=1))

This creates a single instance of class ``MyStep``.
However, Buildbot needs a new object each time the step is executed.
An instance of :class:`~buildbot.process.buildstep.BuildStep` rembers how it was constructed, and can create copies of itself.
When writing a new step class, then, keep in mind are that you cannot do anything "interesting" in the constructor -- limit yourself to checking and storing arguments.

It is customary to call the parent class's constructor with all otherwise-unspecified keyword arguments.
Keep a ``**kwargs`` argument on the end of your options, and pass that up to the parent class's constructor.

The whole thing looks like this::

    class Frobnify(LoggingBuildStep):
        def __init__(self,
                frob_what="frobee",
                frob_how_many=None,
                frob_how=None,
                **kwargs):
    
            # check
            if frob_how_many is None:
                raise TypeError("Frobnify argument how_many is required")

            # override a parent option
            kwargs['parentOpt'] = 'xyz'
    
            # call parent
            LoggingBuildStep.__init__(self, **kwargs)
    
            # set Frobnify attributes
            self.frob_what = frob_what
            self.frob_how_many = how_many
            self.frob_how = frob_how
    
    class FastFrobnify(Frobnify):
        def __init__(self,
                speed=5,
                **kwargs)
            Frobnify.__init__(self, **kwargs)
            self.speed = speed

Running Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To spawn a command in the buildslave, create a :class:`~buildbot.process.buildstep.RemoteCommand` instance in your step's ``start`` method and run it with :meth:`~buildbot.process.buildstep.BuildStep.runCommand`::

    cmd = RemoteCommand(args)
    d = self.runCommand(cmd)

To add a LogFile, use :meth:`~buildbot.process.buildstep.BuildStep.addLog`.
Make sure the log gets closed when it finishes.
When giving a Logfile to a :class:`~buildbot.process.buildstep.RemoteShellCommand`, just ask it to close the log when the command completes::

    log = self.addLog('output')
    cmd.useLog(log, closeWhenFinished=True)

Updating Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TBD

.. todo::

    What *is* the best way to do this?  From the docstring:

    As the step runs, it should send status information to the
    BuildStepStatus::

        self.step_status.setText(['compile', 'failed'])
        self.step_status.setText2(['4', 'warnings'])

Capturing Logfiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each BuildStep has a collection of `logfiles`. Each one has a short
name, like `stdio` or `warnings`. Each :class:`LogFile` contains an
arbitrary amount of text, usually the contents of some output file
generated during a build or test step, or a record of everything that
was printed to :file:`stdout`/:file:`stderr` during the execution of some command.

These :class:`LogFile`\s are stored to disk, so they can be retrieved later.

Each can contain multiple `channels`, generally limited to three
basic ones: stdout, stderr, and `headers`. For example, when a
ShellCommand runs, it writes a few lines to the `headers` channel to
indicate the exact argv strings being run, which directory the command
is being executed in, and the contents of the current environment
variables. Then, as the command runs, it adds a lot of :file:`stdout` and
:file:`stderr` messages. When the command finishes, a final `header`
line is added with the exit code of the process.

Status display plugins can format these different channels in
different ways. For example, the web page shows LogFiles as text/html,
with header lines in blue text, stdout in black, and stderr in red. A
different URL is available which provides a text/plain format, in
which stdout and stderr are collapsed together, and header lines are
stripped completely. This latter option makes it easy to save the
results to a file and run :command:`grep` or whatever against the
output.

Each :class:`BuildStep` contains a mapping (implemented in a python dictionary)
from :class:`LogFile` name to the actual :class:`LogFile` objects. Status plugins can
get a list of LogFiles to display, for example, a list of HREF links
that, when clicked, provide the full contents of the :class:`LogFile`.

Using LogFiles in custom BuildSteps
###################################

The most common way for a custom :class:`BuildStep` to use a :class:`LogFile` is to
summarize the results of a :bb:step:`ShellCommand` (after the command has
finished running). For example, a compile step with thousands of lines
of output might want to create a summary of just the warning messages.
If you were doing this from a shell, you would use something like:

.. code-block:: bash

    grep "warning:" output.log >warnings.log

In a custom BuildStep, you could instead create a ``warnings`` :class:`LogFile`
that contained the same text. To do this, you would add code to your
:meth:`createSummary` method that pulls lines from the main output log
and creates a new :class:`LogFile` with the results::

    def createSummary(self, log):
        warnings = []
        sio = StringIO.StringIO(log.getText())
        for line in sio.readlines():
            if "warning:" in line:
                warnings.append()
        self.addCompleteLog('warnings', "".join(warnings))

This example uses the :meth:`addCompleteLog` method, which creates a
new :class:`LogFile`, puts some text in it, and then `closes` it, meaning
that no further contents will be added. This :class:`LogFile` will appear in
the HTML display under an HREF with the name `warnings`, since that
is the name of the :class:`LogFile`.

You can also use :meth:`addHTMLLog` to create a complete (closed)
:class:`LogFile` that contains HTML instead of plain text. The normal :class:`LogFile`
will be HTML-escaped if presented through a web page, but the HTML
:class:`LogFile` will not. At the moment this is only used to present a pretty
HTML representation of an otherwise ugly exception traceback when
something goes badly wrong during the :class:`BuildStep`.

In contrast, you might want to create a new :class:`LogFile` at the beginning
of the step, and add text to it as the command runs. You can create
the :class:`LogFile` and attach it to the build by calling :meth:`addLog`, which
returns the :class:`LogFile` object. You then add text to this :class:`LogFile` by
calling methods like :meth:`addStdout` and :meth:`addHeader`. When you
are done, you must call the :meth:`finish` method so the :class:`LogFile` can be
closed. It may be useful to create and populate a :class:`LogFile` like this
from a :class:`LogObserver` method - see :ref:`Adding-LogObservers`.

The ``logfiles=`` argument to :bb:step:`ShellCommand` (see
:bb:step:`ShellCommand`) creates new :class:`LogFile`\s and fills them in realtime
by asking the buildslave to watch a actual file on disk. The
buildslave will look for additions in the target file and report them
back to the :class:`BuildStep`. These additions will be added to the :class:`LogFile` by
calling :meth:`addStdout`. These secondary LogFiles can be used as the
source of a LogObserver just like the normal :file:`stdio` :class:`LogFile`.

Reading Logfiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once a :class:`~buildbot.status.logfile.LogFile` has been added to a
:class:`~buildbot.process.buildstep.BuildStep` with
:meth:`~buildbot.process.buildstep.BuildStep.addLog()`,
:meth:`~buildbot.process.buildstep.BuildStep.addCompleteLog()`,
:meth:`~buildbot.process.buildstep.BuildStep.addHTMLLog()`, or ``logfiles={}``,
your :class:`~buildbot.process.buildstep.BuildStep.BuildStep` can retrieve it
by using :meth:`~buildbot.process.buildstep.BuildStep.getLog()`::

    class MyBuildStep(ShellCommand):
        logfiles = @{ "nodelog": "_test/node.log" @}

        def evaluateCommand(self, cmd):
            nodelog = self.getLog("nodelog")
            if "STARTED" in nodelog.getText():
                return SUCCESS
            else:
                return FAILURE

.. _Adding-LogObservers:

Adding LogObservers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most shell commands emit messages to stdout or stderr as they operate,
especially if you ask them nicely with a :option:`--verbose` flag of some
sort. They may also write text to a log file while they run. Your
:class:`BuildStep` can watch this output as it arrives, to keep track of how
much progress the command has made. You can get a better measure of
progress by counting the number of source files compiled or test cases
run than by merely tracking the number of bytes that have been written
to stdout. This improves the accuracy and the smoothness of the ETA
display.

To accomplish this, you will need to attach a :class:`LogObserver` to
one of the log channels, most commonly to the :file:`stdio` channel but
perhaps to another one which tracks a log file. This observer is given
all text as it is emitted from the command, and has the opportunity to
parse that output incrementally. Once the observer has decided that
some event has occurred (like a source file being compiled), it can
use the :meth:`setProgress` method to tell the :class:`BuildStep` about the
progress that this event represents.

There are a number of pre-built :class:`LogObserver` classes that you
can choose from (defined in :mod:`buildbot.process.buildstep`, and of
course you can subclass them to add further customization. The
:class:`LogLineObserver` class handles the grunt work of buffering and
scanning for end-of-line delimiters, allowing your parser to operate
on complete :file:`stdout`/:file:`stderr` lines. (Lines longer than a set maximum
length are dropped; the maximum defaults to 16384 bytes, but you can
change it by calling :meth:`setMaxLineLength()` on your
:class:`LogLineObserver` instance.  Use ``sys.maxint`` for effective
infinity.)

For example, let's take a look at the :class:`TrialTestCaseCounter`,
which is used by the :bb:step:`Trial` step to count test cases as they are run.
As Trial executes, it emits lines like the following:

.. code-block:: none

    buildbot.test.test_config.ConfigTest.testDebugPassword ... [OK]
    buildbot.test.test_config.ConfigTest.testEmpty ... [OK]
    buildbot.test.test_config.ConfigTest.testIRC ... [FAIL]
    buildbot.test.test_config.ConfigTest.testLocks ... [OK]

When the tests are finished, trial emits a long line of `======` and
then some lines which summarize the tests that failed. We want to
avoid parsing these trailing lines, because their format is less
well-defined than the `[OK]` lines.

The parser class looks like this::

    from buildbot.process.buildstep import LogLineObserver
    
    class TrialTestCaseCounter(LogLineObserver):
        _line_re = re.compile(r'^([\w\.]+) \.\.\. \[([^\]]+)\]$')
        numTests = 0
        finished = False
    
        def outLineReceived(self, line):
            if self.finished:
                return
            if line.startswith("=" * 40):
                self.finished = True
                return
    
            m = self._line_re.search(line.strip())
            if m:
                testname, result = m.groups()
                self.numTests += 1
                self.step.setProgress('tests', self.numTests)

This parser only pays attention to stdout, since that's where trial
writes the progress lines. It has a mode flag named ``finished`` to
ignore everything after the ``====`` marker, and a scary-looking
regular expression to match each line while hopefully ignoring other
messages that might get displayed as the test runs.

Each time it identifies a test has been completed, it increments its
counter and delivers the new progress value to the step with
@code{self.step.setProgress}. This class is specifically measuring
progress along the `tests` metric, in units of test cases (as
opposed to other kinds of progress like the `output` metric, which
measures in units of bytes). The Progress-tracking code uses each
progress metric separately to come up with an overall completion
percentage and an ETA value.

To connect this parser into the :bb:step:`Trial` build step,
``Trial.__init__`` ends with the following clause::

    # this counter will feed Progress along the 'test cases' metric
    counter = TrialTestCaseCounter()
    self.addLogObserver('stdio', counter)
    self.progressMetrics += ('tests',)

This creates a :class:`TrialTestCaseCounter` and tells the step that the
counter wants to watch the :file:`stdio` log. The observer is
automatically given a reference to the step in its :attr:`step`
attribute.

Using Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In custom :class:`BuildSteps`, you can get and set the build properties with
the :meth:`getProperty`/:meth:`setProperty` methods. Each takes a string
for the name of the property, and returns or accepts an
arbitrary object. For example::

    class MakeTarball(ShellCommand):
        def start(self):
            if self.getProperty("os") == "win":
                self.setCommand([ ... ]) # windows-only command
            else:
                self.setCommand([ ... ]) # equivalent for other systems
            ShellCommand.start(self)

Remember that properties set in a step may not be available until the next step
begins.  In particular, any :class:`Property` or :class:`Interpolate`
instances for the current step are interpoloated before the ``start`` method
begins.

.. index:: links, BuildStep URLs, addURL

BuildStep URLs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each BuildStep has a collection of `links`. Like its collection of
LogFiles, each link has a name and a target URL. The web status page
creates HREFs for each link in the same box as it does for LogFiles,
except that the target of the link is the external URL instead of an
internal link to a page that shows the contents of the LogFile.

These external links can be used to point at build information hosted
on other servers. For example, the test process might produce an
intricate description of which tests passed and failed, or some sort
of code coverage data in HTML form, or a PNG or GIF image with a graph
of memory usage over time. The external link can provide an easy way
for users to navigate from the buildbot's status page to these
external web sites or file servers. Note that the step itself is
responsible for insuring that there will be a document available at
the given URL (perhaps by using :command:`scp` to copy the HTML output
to a :file:`~/public_html/` directory on a remote web server). Calling
:meth:`addURL` does not magically populate a web server.

To set one of these links, the :class:`BuildStep` should call the :meth:`addURL`
method with the name of the link and the target URL. Multiple URLs can
be set.

In this example, we assume that the ``make test`` command causes
a collection of HTML files to be created and put somewhere on the
coverage.example.org web server, in a filename that incorporates the
build number. ::

    class TestWithCodeCoverage(BuildStep):
        command = ["make", "test",
                   Interpolate("buildnum=%(prop:buildnumber)s")]
    
        def createSummary(self, log):
            buildnumber = self.getProperty("buildnumber")
            url = "http://coverage.example.org/builds/%s.html" % buildnumber
            self.addURL("coverage", url)

You might also want to extract the URL from some special message
output by the build process itself::

    class TestWithCodeCoverage(BuildStep):
        command = ["make", "test",
                   Interpolate("buildnum=%(prop:buildnumber)s")]
    
        def createSummary(self, log):
            output = StringIO(log.getText())
            for line in output.readlines():
                if line.startswith("coverage-url:"):
                    url = line[len("coverage-url:"):].strip()
                    self.addURL("coverage", url)
                    return

Note that a build process which emits both :file:`stdout` and :file:`stderr` might
cause this line to be split or interleaved between other lines. It
might be necessary to restrict the :meth:`getText()` call to only stdout with
something like this::

    output = StringIO("".join([c[1]
                               for c in log.getChunks()
                               if c[0] == LOG_CHANNEL_STDOUT]))

Of course if the build is run under a PTY, then stdout and stderr will
be merged before the buildbot ever sees them, so such interleaving
will be unavoidable.

.. todo::

    Step Progress
    BuildStepFailed
    Running Multiple Commands

A Somewhat Whimsical Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's say that we've got some snazzy new unit-test framework called
Framboozle. It's the hottest thing since sliced bread. It slices, it
dices, it runs unit tests like there's no tomorrow. Plus if your unit
tests fail, you can use its name for a Web 2.1 startup company, make
millions of dollars, and hire engineers to fix the bugs for you, while
you spend your afternoons lazily hang-gliding along a scenic pacific
beach, blissfully unconcerned about the state of your
tests. [#framboozle_reg]_

To run a Framboozle-enabled test suite, you just run the 'framboozler'
command from the top of your source code tree. The 'framboozler'
command emits a bunch of stuff to stdout, but the most interesting bit
is that it emits the line "FNURRRGH!" every time it finishes running a
test case You'd like to have a test-case counting LogObserver that
watches for these lines and counts them, because counting them will
help the buildbot more accurately calculate how long the build will
take, and this will let you know exactly how long you can sneak out of
the office for your hang-gliding lessons without anyone noticing that
you're gone.

This will involve writing a new :class:`BuildStep` (probably named
"Framboozle") which inherits from :bb:step:`ShellCommand`. The :class:`BuildStep` class
definition itself will look something like this::

    from buildbot.steps.shell import ShellCommand
    from buildbot.process.buildstep import LogLineObserver
    
    class FNURRRGHCounter(LogLineObserver):
        numTests = 0
        def outLineReceived(self, line):
            if "FNURRRGH!" in line:
                self.numTests += 1
                self.step.setProgress('tests', self.numTests)
    
    class Framboozle(ShellCommand):
        command = ["framboozler"]
    
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            ShellCommand.__init__(self, **kwargs)   # always upcall!
            counter = FNURRRGHCounter())
            self.addLogObserver('stdio', counter)
            self.progressMetrics += ('tests',)

So that's the code that we want to wind up using. How do we actually
deploy it?

You have a couple of different options.

Option 1: The simplest technique is to simply put this text
(everything from START to FINISH) in your :FILE:`master.cfg` file, somewhere
before the :class:`BuildFactory` definition where you actually use it in a
clause like::

    f = BuildFactory()
    f.addStep(SVN(svnurl="stuff"))
    f.addStep(Framboozle())

Remember that :file:`master.cfg` is secretly just a python program with one
job: populating the :file:`BuildmasterConfig` dictionary. And python programs
are allowed to define as many classes as they like. So you can define
classes and use them in the same file, just as long as the class is
defined before some other code tries to use it.

This is easy, and it keeps the point of definition very close to the
point of use, and whoever replaces you after that unfortunate
hang-gliding accident will appreciate being able to easily figure out
what the heck this stupid "Framboozle" step is doing anyways. The
downside is that every time you reload the config file, the Framboozle
class will get redefined, which means that the buildmaster will think
that you've reconfigured all the Builders that use it, even though
nothing changed. Bleh.

Option 2: Instead, we can put this code in a separate file, and import
it into the master.cfg file just like we would the normal buildsteps
like :bb:step:`ShellCommand` and :bb:step:`SVN`.

Create a directory named ~/lib/python, put everything from START to
FINISH in :file:`~/lib/python/framboozle.py`, and run your buildmaster using:

.. code-block:: bash

    PYTHONPATH=~/lib/python buildbot start MASTERDIR

or use the :file:`Makefile.buildbot` to control the way
``buildbot start`` works. Or add something like this to
something like your :file:`~/.bashrc` or :file:`~/.bash_profile` or :file:`~/.cshrc`:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PYTHONPATH=~/lib/python

Once we've done this, our :file:`master.cfg` can look like::

    from framboozle import Framboozle
    f = BuildFactory()
    f.addStep(SVN(svnurl="stuff"))
    f.addStep(Framboozle())

or::

    import framboozle
    f = BuildFactory()
    f.addStep(SVN(svnurl="stuff"))
    f.addStep(framboozle.Framboozle())

(check out the python docs for details about how "import" and "from A
import B" work).

What we've done here is to tell python that every time it handles an
"import" statement for some named module, it should look in our
:file:`~/lib/python/` for that module before it looks anywhere else. After our
directories, it will try in a bunch of standard directories too
(including the one where buildbot is installed). By setting the
:envvar:`PYTHONPATH` environment variable, you can add directories to the front
of this search list.

Python knows that once it "import"s a file, it doesn't need to
re-import it again. This means that reconfiguring the buildmaster
(with ``buildbot reconfig``, for example) won't make it think the
Framboozle class has changed every time, so the Builders that use it
will not be spuriously restarted. On the other hand, you either have
to start your buildmaster in a slightly weird way, or you have to
modify your environment to set the :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` variable.


Option 3: Install this code into a standard python library directory

Find out what your python's standard include path is by asking it:

.. code-block:: none

    80:warner@luther% python
    Python 2.4.4c0 (#2, Oct  2 2006, 00:57:46)
    [GCC 4.1.2 20060928 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-15)] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> import sys
    >>> import pprint
    >>> pprint.pprint(sys.path)
    ['',
     '/usr/lib/python24.zip',
     '/usr/lib/python2.4',
     '/usr/lib/python2.4/plat-linux2',
     '/usr/lib/python2.4/lib-tk',
     '/usr/lib/python2.4/lib-dynload',
     '/usr/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages',
     '/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages',
     '/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/Numeric',
     '/var/lib/python-support/python2.4',
     '/usr/lib/site-python']

In this case, putting the code into
/usr/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages/framboozle.py would work just
fine. We can use the same :file:`master.cfg` ``import framboozle`` statement as
in Option 2. By putting it in a standard include directory (instead of
the decidedly non-standard :file:`~/lib/python`), we don't even have to set
:envvar:`PYTHONPATH` to anything special. The downside is that you probably have
to be root to write to one of those standard include directories.


Option 4: Submit the code for inclusion in the Buildbot distribution

Make a fork of buildbot on http://github.com/djmitche/buildbot or post a patch
in a bug at http://buildbot.net.  In either case, post a note about your patch
to the mailing list, so others can provide feedback and, eventually, commit it.

    from buildbot.steps import framboozle
    f = BuildFactory()
    f.addStep(SVN(svnurl="stuff"))
    f.addStep(framboozle.Framboozle())

And then you don't even have to install framboozle.py anywhere on your system,
since it will ship with Buildbot. You don't have to be root, you don't have to
set :envvar:`PYTHONPATH`. But you do have to make a good case for Framboozle
being worth going into the main distribution, you'll probably have to provide
docs and some unit test cases, you'll need to figure out what kind of beer the
author likes (IPA's and Stouts for Dustin), and then you'll have to wait until
the next release. But in some environments, all this is easier than getting
root on your buildmaster box, so the tradeoffs may actually be worth it.

Putting the code in master.cfg (1) makes it available to that
buildmaster instance. Putting it in a file in a personal library
directory (2) makes it available for any buildmasters you might be
running. Putting it in a file in a system-wide shared library
directory (3) makes it available for any buildmasters that anyone on
that system might be running. Getting it into the buildbot's upstream
repository (4) makes it available for any buildmasters that anyone in
the world might be running. It's all a matter of how widely you want
to deploy that new class.

Writing New Status Plugins
--------------------------

Each status plugin is an object which provides the
:class:`twisted.application.service.IService` interface, which creates a
tree of Services with the buildmaster at the top [not strictly true].
The status plugins are all children of an object which implements
:class:`buildbot.interfaces.IStatus`, the main status object. From this
object, the plugin can retrieve anything it wants about current and
past builds. It can also subscribe to hear about new and upcoming
builds.

Status plugins which only react to human queries (like the Waterfall
display) never need to subscribe to anything: they are idle until
someone asks a question, then wake up and extract the information they
need to answer it, then they go back to sleep. Plugins which need to
act spontaneously when builds complete (like the :class:`MailNotifier` plugin)
need to subscribe to hear about new builds.

If the status plugin needs to run network services (like the HTTP
server used by the Waterfall plugin), they can be attached as Service
children of the plugin itself, using the :class:`IServiceCollection`
interface.

.. [#framboozle_reg] framboozle.com is still available. Remember, I get 10% :).
