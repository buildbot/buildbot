.. _Build-Steps:

Build Steps
===========

:class:`BuildStep`\s are usually specified in the buildmaster's
configuration file, in a list that goes into the :class:`BuildFactory`.
The :class:`BuildStep` instances in this list are used as templates to
construct new independent copies for each build (so that state can be
kept on the :class:`BuildStep` in one build without affecting a later
build). Each :class:`BuildFactory` can be created with a list of steps,
or the factory can be created empty and then steps added to it using
the :meth:`addStep` method::

    from buildbot.steps import source, shell
    from buildbot.process import factory

    f = factory.BuildFactory()
    f.addStep(source.SVN(svnurl="http://svn.example.org/Trunk/"))
    f.addStep(shell.ShellCommand(command=["make", "all"]))
    f.addStep(shell.ShellCommand(command=["make", "test"]))

The basic behavior for a :class:`BuildStep` is to:

  * run for a while, then stop
  * possibly invoke some RemoteCommands on the attached build slave
  * possibly produce a set of log files
  * finish with a status described by one of four values defined in
    :mod:`buildbot.status.builder`: ``SUCCESS``, ``WARNINGS``, ``FAILURE``, ``SKIPPED``
  * provide a list of short strings to describe the step

The rest of this section describes all the standard :class:`BuildStep` objects
available for use in a :class:`Build`, and the parameters which can be used to
control each.  A full list of build steps is available in the :bb:index:`step`.

.. index:: Buildstep Parameter

.. _Buildstep-Common-Parameters:

Common Parameters
-----------------

All :class:`BuildStep`\s accept some common parameters. Some of these control
how their individual status affects the overall build. Others are used
to specify which `Locks` (see :ref:`Interlocks`) should be
acquired before allowing the step to run.

Arguments common to all :class:`BuildStep` subclasses:

``name``
    the name used to describe the step on the status display. It is also
    used to give a name to any :class:`LogFile`\s created by this step.

.. index:: Buildstep Parameter; haltOnFailure

``haltOnFailure``
    if ``True``, a ``FAILURE`` of this build step will cause the build to halt
    immediately. Steps with ``alwaysRun=True`` are still run. Generally
    speaking, ``haltOnFailure`` implies ``flunkOnFailure`` (the default for most
    :class:`BuildStep`\s). In some cases, particularly series of tests, it makes sense
    to ``haltOnFailure`` if something fails early on but not ``flunkOnFailure``.
    This can be achieved with ``haltOnFailure=True``, ``flunkOnFailure=False``.

.. index:: Buildstep Parameter; flunkOnWarnings

``flunkOnWarnings``
    when ``True``, a ``WARNINGS`` or ``FAILURE`` of this build step will mark the
    overall build as ``FAILURE``. The remaining steps will still be executed.

.. index:: Buildstep Parameter; flunkOnFailure

``flunkOnFailure``
    when ``True``, a ``FAILURE`` of this build step will mark the overall build as
    a ``FAILURE``. The remaining steps will still be executed.

.. index:: Buildstep Parameter; warnOnWarnings

``warnOnWarnings``
    when ``True``, a ``WARNINGS`` or ``FAILURE`` of this build step will mark the
    overall build as having ``WARNINGS``. The remaining steps will still be
    executed.

.. index:: Buildstep Parameter; warnOnFailure

``warnOnFailure``
    when ``True``, a ``FAILURE`` of this build step will mark the overall build as
    having ``WARNINGS``. The remaining steps will still be executed.

.. index:: Buildstep Parameter; alwaysRun

``alwaysRun``
    if ``True``, this build step will always be run, even if a previous buildstep
    with ``haltOnFailure=True`` has failed.

.. index:: Buildstep Parameter; description

``description``
    This will be used to describe the command (on the Waterfall display)
    while the command is still running. It should be a single
    imperfect-tense verb, like `compiling` or `testing`. The preferred
    form is a list of short strings, which allows the HTML
    displays to create narrower columns by emitting a <br> tag between each
    word. You may also provide a single string.

.. index:: Buildstep Parameter; descriptionDone

``descriptionDone``
    This will be used to describe the command once it has finished. A
    simple noun like `compile` or `tests` should be used. Like
    ``description``, this may either be a list of short strings or a
    single string.

    If neither ``description`` nor ``descriptionDone`` are set, the
    actual command arguments will be used to construct the description.
    This may be a bit too wide to fit comfortably on the Waterfall
    display.

    All subclasses of :py:class:`BuildStep` will contain the description
    attributes. Consequently, you could add a :py:class:`ShellCommand`
    step like so:

    ::

        from buildbot.steps.shell import ShellCommand
        f.addStep(ShellCommand(command=["make", "test"],
                               description=["testing"],
                               descriptionDone=["tests"]))

.. index:: Buildstep Parameter; descriptionSuffix

``descriptionSuffix``
    This is an optional suffix appended to the end of the description (ie,
    after ``description`` and ``descriptionDone``). This can be used to distinguish
    between build steps that would display the same descriptions in the waterfall.
    This parameter may be set to list of short strings, a single string, or ``None``.

    For example, a builder might use the ``Compile`` step to build two different
    codebases. The ``descriptionSuffix`` could be set to `projectFoo` and `projectBar`,
    respectively for each step, which will result in the full descriptions
    `compiling projectFoo` and `compiling projectBar` to be shown in the waterfall.

.. index:: Buildstep Parameter; doStepIf

``doStepIf``
    A step can be configured to only run under certain conditions.  To do this, set
    the step's ``doStepIf`` to a boolean value, or to a function that returns a
    boolean value or Deferred.  If the value or function result is false, then the step will
    return ``SKIPPED`` without doing anything.  Otherwise, the step will be executed
    normally.  If you set ``doStepIf`` to a function, that function should
    accept one parameter, which will be the :class:`Step` object itself.

.. index:: Buildstep Parameter; hideStepIf

``hideStepIf``
    A step can be optionally hidden from the waterfall and build details web pages.
    To do this, set the step's ``hideStepIf`` to a boolean value, or to a function that takes two parameters -- the results and the :class:`BuildStep` -- and returns a boolean value.
    Steps are always shown while they execute, however after the step as finished, this parameter is evaluated (if a function) and if the value is True, the step is hidden.
    For example, in order to hide the step if the step has been skipped, ::

        factory.addStep(Foo(..., hideStepIf=lambda results, s: results==SKIPPED))

.. index:: Buildstep Parameter; locks

``locks``
    a list of ``Locks`` (instances of :class:`buildbot.locks.SlaveLock` or
    :class:`buildbot.locks.MasterLock`) that should be acquired before starting this
    :class:`Step`. The ``Locks`` will be released when the step is complete. Note that this is a
    list of actual :class:`Lock` instances, not names. Also note that all Locks must have
    unique names.  See :ref:`Interlocks`.

.. _Source-Checkout:

Source Checkout
---------------

.. py:module:: buildbot.steps.source

At the moment, Buildbot contains two implementations of most source steps.  The
new implementation handles most of the logic on the master side, and has a
simpler, more unified approach.  The older implementation
(:ref:`Source-Checkout-Slave-Side`) handles the logic on the slave side, and
some of the classes have a bewildering array of options.

.. caution:: Master-side source checkout steps are recently developed and not
    stable yet. If you find any bugs please report them on the `Buildbot Trac
    <http://trac.buildbot.net/newticket>`_. The older Slave-side described source
    steps are :ref:`Source-Checkout-Slave-Side`.

    The old source steps are imported like this::

        from buildbot.steps.source import Git

    while new source steps are in separate source-packages for each
    version-control system::

        from buildbot.steps.source.git import Git


New users should, where possible, use the new implementations.  The old
implementations will be deprecated in a later release.  Old users should take
this opportunity to switch to the new implementations while both are supported
by Buildbot.

Some version control systems have not yet been implemented as master-side
steps.  If you are interested in continued support for such a version control
system, please consider helping the Buildbot developers to create such an
implementation.  In particular, version-control systems with proprietary
licenses will not be supported without access to the version-control system
for development.

Common Parameters
+++++++++++++++++

All source checkout steps accept some common parameters to control how they get
the sources and where they should be placed. The remaining per-VC-system
parameters are mostly to specify where exactly the sources are coming from.

``mode``
``method``

    These two parameters specify the means by which the source is checked out.
    ``mode`` specifies the type of checkout and ``method`` tells about the
    way to implement it. ::

        factory = BuildFactory()
        from buildbot.steps.source.mercurial import Mercurial
        factory.addStep(Mercurial(repourl='path/to/repo', mode='full', method='fresh'))

    The ``mode`` parameter a string describing the kind of VC operation that is
    desired, defaulting to ``incremental``.  The options are

    ``incremental``
        Update the source to the desired revision, but do not remove any other files
        generated by previous builds.  This allows compilers to take advantage of
        object files from previous builds.  This mode is exactly same as the old
        ``update`` mode.

    ``full``
        Update the source, but delete remnants of previous builds.  Build steps that
        follow will need to regenerate all object files.

    Methods are specific to the version-control system in question, as they may
    take advantage of special behaviors in that version-control system that can
    make checkouts more efficient or reliable.

``workdir``
    like all Steps, this indicates the directory where the build will take
    place. Source Steps are special in that they perform some operations
    outside of the workdir (like creating the workdir itself).

``alwaysUseLatest``
    if True, bypass the usual behavior of checking out the revision in the
    source stamp, and always update to the latest revision in the repository
    instead.

``retry``
    If set, this specifies a tuple of ``(delay, repeats)`` which means
    that when a full VC checkout fails, it should be retried up to
    ``repeats`` times, waiting ``delay`` seconds between attempts. If
    you don't provide this, it defaults to ``None``, which means VC
    operations should not be retried. This is provided to make life easier
    for buildslaves which are stuck behind poor network connections.

``repository``
    The name of this parameter might vary depending on the Source step you
    are running. The concept explained here is common to all steps and
    applies to ``repourl`` as well as for ``baseURL`` (when
    applicable).

    A common idiom is to pass ``Property('repository', 'url://default/repo/path')``
    as repository. This grabs the repository from the source stamp of the
    build. This can be a security issue, if you allow force builds from the
    web, or have the :class:`WebStatus` change hooks enabled; as the buildslave
    will download code from an arbitrary repository.

``codebase``
    This specifies which codebase the source step should use to select the right
    source stamp. The default codebase value is ''. The codebase must correspond
    to a codebase assigned by the :bb:cfg:`codebaseGenerator`. If there is no
    codebaseGenerator defined in the master then codebase doesn't need to be set,
    the default value will then match all changes.

``timeout``
    Specifies the timeout for slave-side operations, in seconds.  If
    your repositories are particularly large, then you may need to
    increase this  value from its default of 1200 (20 minutes).

``logEnviron``
    If this option is true (the default), then the step's logfile will
    describe the environment variables on the slave. In situations
    where the environment is not relevant and is long, it may be
    easier to set logEnviron=False.

``env``
    a dictionary of environment strings which will be added to the child
    command's environment.  The usual property interpolations can be used in
    environment variable names and values - see :ref:`Properties`.

.. bb:step:: Mercurial

.. _Step-Mercurial:

Mercurial
+++++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.source.mercurial.Mercurial

The :bb:step:`Mercurial` build step performs a `Mercurial <http://selenic.com/mercurial>`_
(aka ``hg``) checkout or update.

Branches are available in two modes: ``dirname``, where the name of the branch is
a suffix of the name of the repository, or ``inrepo``, which uses Hg's
named-branches support. Make sure this setting matches your changehook, if you
have that installed. ::

   from buildbot.steps.source.mercurial import Mercurial
   factory.addStep(Mercurial(repourl='path/to/repo', mode='full',
                             method='fresh', branchType='inrepo'))

The Mercurial step takes the following arguments:

``repourl``
   where the Mercurial source repository is available.

``defaultBranch``
   this specifies the name of the branch to use when a Build does not provide
   one of its own. This will be appended to ``repourl`` to create the
   string that will be passed to the ``hg clone`` command.

``branchType``
   either 'dirname' (default) or 'inrepo' depending on whether the
   branch name should be appended to the ``repourl`` or the branch
   is a Mercurial named branch and can be found within the ``repourl``.

``clobberOnBranchChange``
   boolean, defaults to ``True``. If set and using inrepos branches,
   clobber the tree at each branch change. Otherwise, just update to
   the branch.

``mode``
``method``

   Mercurial's incremental mode does not require a method.  The full mode has
   three methods defined:


   ``clobber``
      It removes the build directory entirely then makes full clone
      from repo. This can be slow as it need to clone whole repository

   ``fresh``
      This remove all other files except those tracked by VCS. First
      it does :command:`hg purge --all` then pull/update

   ``clean``
      All the files which are tracked by Mercurial and listed ignore
      files are not deleted. Remaining all other files will be deleted
      before pull/update. This is equivalent to :command:`hg purge`
      then pull/update.

.. bb:step:: Git

.. _Step-Git:

Git
+++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.source.git.Git

The ``Git`` build step clones or updates a `Git <http://git.or.cz/>`_
repository and checks out the specified branch or revision. Note that
the buildbot supports Git version 1.2.0 and later: earlier versions
(such as the one shipped in Ubuntu 'Dapper') do not support the
:command:`git init` command that the buildbot uses. ::

   from buildbot.steps.source.git import Git
   factory.addStep(Git(repourl='git://path/to/repo', mode='full',
                             method='clobber', submodules=True))

The Git step takes the following arguments:

``repourl``
   (required): the URL of the upstream Git repository.

``branch``
   (optional): this specifies the name of the branch to use when a Build does not provide one of its own.
   If this this parameter is not specified, and the Build does not provide a branch, the default branch of the remote repository will be used.

``submodules``
   (optional): when initializing/updating a Git repository, this
   decides whether or not buildbot should consider Git submodules.
   Default: ``False``.

``shallow``
   (optional): instructs git to attempt shallow clones (``--depth 1``).
   This option can be used only in full builds with clobber method.

``reference``
   (optional): use the specified string as a path to a reference
   repository on the local machine. Git will try to grab objects from
   this path first instead of the main repository, if they exist.

``progress``
   (optional): passes the (``--progress``) flag to (:command:`git
   fetch`). This solves issues of long fetches being killed due to
   lack of output, but requires Git 1.7.2 or later.

``retryFetch``
   (optional): defaults to ``False``.
   If true, if the ``git fetch`` fails then buildbot retries to fetch again instead of failing the entire source checkout.

``clobberOnFailure``
   (optional): defaults to ``False``. If a fetch or full clone
   fails we can checkout source removing everything. This way new
   repository will be cloned. If retry fails it fails the source
   checkout step.

``mode``

  (optional): defaults to ``'incremental'``.
  Specifies whether to clean the build tree or not.

    ``incremental``
      The source is update, but any built files are left untouched.

    ``full``
      The build tree is clean of any built files.
      The exact method for doing this is controlled by the ``method`` argument.


``method``

   (optional): defaults to ``fresh`` when mode is ``full``.
   Git's incremental mode does not require a method.
   The full mode has four methods defined:


   ``clobber``
      It removes the build directory entirely then makes full clone
      from repo. This can be slow as it need to clone whole repository. To make
      faster clones enable ``shallow`` option. If shallow options is enabled and
      build request have unknown revision value, then this step fails.

   ``fresh``
      This remove all other files except those tracked by Git. First
      it does :command:`git clean -d -f -f -x` then fetch/checkout to a
      specified revision(if any). This option is equal to update mode
      with ``ignore_ignores=True`` in old steps.

   ``clean``
      All the files which are tracked by Git and listed ignore files
      are not deleted. Remaining all other files will be deleted
      before fetch/checkout. This is equivalent to :command:`git clean
      -d -f -f` then fetch. This is equivalent to
      ``ignore_ignores=False`` in old steps.

   ``copy``
      This first checkout source into source directory then copy the
      ``source`` directory to ``build`` directory then performs the
      build operation in the copied directory. This way we make fresh
      builds with very less bandwidth to download source. The behavior
      of source checkout follows exactly same as incremental. It
      performs all the incremental checkout behavior in ``source``
      directory.

``getDescription``

   (optional) After checkout, invoke a `git describe` on the revision and save
   the result in a property; the property's name is either ``commit-description``
   or ``commit-description-foo``, depending on whether the ``codebase``
   argument was also provided. The argument should either be a ``bool`` or ``dict``,
   and will change how `git describe` is called:

   * ``getDescription=False``: disables this feature explicitly
   * ``getDescription=True`` or empty ``dict()``: Run `git describe` with no args
   * ``getDescription={...}``: a dict with keys named the same as the Git option.
     Each key's value can be ``False`` or ``None`` to explicitly skip that argument.

     For the following keys, a value of ``True`` appends the same-named Git argument:

      * ``all`` : `--all`
      * ``always``: `--always`
      * ``contains``: `--contains`
      * ``debug``: `--debug`
      * ``long``: `--long``
      * ``exact-match``: `--exact-match`
      * ``tags``: `--tags`
      * ``dirty``: `--dirty`

     For the following keys, an integer or string value (depending on what Git expects)
     will set the argument's parameter appropriately. Examples show the key-value pair:

      * ``match=foo``: `--match foo`
      * ``abbrev=7``: `--abbrev=7`
      * ``candidates=7``: `--candidates=7`
      * ``dirty=foo``: `--dirty=foo`

``config``

   (optional) A dict of git configuration settings to pass to the remote git commands.

.. bb:step:: SVN

.. _Step-SVN:

SVN
+++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.source.svn.SVN

The :bb:step:`SVN` build step performs a `Subversion <http://subversion.tigris.org>`_
checkout or update. There are two
basic ways of setting up the checkout step, depending upon whether you
are using multiple branches or not.

The :bb:step:`SVN` step should be created with the
``repourl`` argument:

``repourl``
   (required): this specifies the ``URL`` argument that will be
   given to the :command:`svn checkout` command. It dictates both where
   the repository is located and which sub-tree should be
   extracted. One way to specify the branch is to use ``Interpolate``. For
   example, if you wanted to check out the trunk repository, you could use
   ``repourl=Interpolate("http://svn.example.com/repos/%(src::branch)s")``
   Alternatively, if you are using a remote Subversion repository
   which is accessible through HTTP at a URL of ``http://svn.example.com/repos``,
   and you wanted to check out the ``trunk/calc`` sub-tree, you would directly
   use ``repourl="http://svn.example.com/repos/trunk/calc"`` as an
   argument to your :bb:step:`SVN` step.

If you are building from multiple branches, then you should create
the :bb:step:`SVN` step with the ``repourl`` and provide branch
information with ``Interpolate``::

   from buildbot.steps.source.svn import SVN
   factory.addStep(SVN(mode='incremental',
                  repourl=Interpolate('svn://svn.example.org/svn/%(src::branch)s/myproject')))

Alternatively, the ``repourl`` argument can be used to create the :bb:step:`SVN` step without
``Interpolate``::

   from buildbot.steps.source.svn import SVN
   factory.addStep(SVN(mode='full',
                  repourl='svn://svn.example.org/svn/myproject/trunk'))

``username``
   (optional): if specified, this will be passed to the ``svn``
   binary with a ``--username`` option.

``password``
   (optional): if specified, this will be passed to the ``svn`` binary
   with a ``--password`` option.

``extra_args``
   (optional): if specified, an array of strings that will be passed
   as extra arguments to the ``svn`` binary.

``keep_on_purge``
   (optional): specific files or directories to keep between purges,
   like some build outputs that can be reused between builds.

``depth``
   (optional): Specify depth argument to achieve sparse checkout.
   Only available if slave has Subversion 1.5 or higher.

   If set to ``empty`` updates will not pull in any files or
   subdirectories not already present. If set to ``files``, updates will
   pull in any files not already present, but not directories.  If set
   to ``immediates``, updates will pull in any files or subdirectories
   not already present, the new subdirectories will have depth: empty.
   If set to ``infinity``, updates will pull in any files or
   subdirectories not already present; the new subdirectories will
   have depth-infinity. Infinity is equivalent to SVN default update
   behavior, without specifying any depth argument.

``preferLastChangedRev``
   (optional): By default, the ``got_revision`` property is set to the
   repository's global revision ("Revision" in the `svn info` output). Set this
   parameter to ``True`` to have it set to the "Last Changed Rev" instead.

``mode``
``method``

   SVN's incremental mode does not require a method.  The full mode
   has five methods defined:

   ``clobber``
      It removes the working directory for each build then makes full checkout.

   ``fresh``
      This always always purges local changes before updating. This
      deletes unversioned files and reverts everything that would
      appear in a :command:`svn status --no-ignore`. This is equivalent
      to the old update mode with ``always_purge``.

   ``clean``
      This is same as fresh except that it deletes all unversioned
      files generated by :command:`svn status`.

   ``copy``
      This first checkout source into source directory then copy the
      ``source`` directory to ``build`` directory then performs
      the build operation in the copied directory. This way we make
      fresh builds with very less bandwidth to download source. The
      behavior of source checkout follows exactly same as
      incremental. It performs all the incremental checkout behavior
      in ``source`` directory.

   ``export``
      Similar to ``method='copy'``, except using ``svn export`` to create build
      directory so that there are no ``.svn`` directories in the build
      directory.

If you are using branches, you must also make sure your
``ChangeSource`` will report the correct branch names.

.. bb:step:: CVS

.. _Step-CVS:

CVS
+++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.source.cvs.CVS

The :bb:step:`CVS` build step performs a `CVS <http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/>`_
checkout or update. ::

   from buildbot.steps.source.cvs import CVS
   factory.addStep(CVS(mode='incremental',
                  cvsroot=':pserver:me@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/myproj',
                  cvsmodule='buildbot'))

This step takes the following arguments:

``cvsroot``
    (required): specify the CVSROOT value, which points to a CVS repository,
    probably on a remote machine. For example, if Buildbot was hosted in CVS
    then the cvsroot value you would use to get a copy of the Buildbot source
    code might be
    ``:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/buildbot``.

``cvsmodule``
    (required): specify the cvs ``module``, which is generally a
    subdirectory of the CVSROOT. The cvsmodule for the Buildbot source code is
    ``buildbot``.

``branch``
    a string which will be used in a ``-r`` argument. This is most useful for
    specifying a branch to work on. Defaults to ``HEAD``.

``global_options``
    a list of flags to be put before the argument ``checkout`` in the CVS
    command.

``extra_options``
    a list of flags to be put after the ``checkout`` in the CVS command.

``mode``
``method``

    No method is needed for incremental mode.  For full mode, ``method`` can
    take the values shown below. If no value is given, it defaults to
    ``fresh``.

    ``clobber``
        This specifies to remove the ``workdir`` and make a full checkout.

    ``fresh``
        This method first runs ``cvsdisard`` in the build directory, then updates
        it.  This requires ``cvsdiscard`` which is a part of the cvsutil package.

    ``clean``
        This method is the same as ``method='fresh'``, but it runs ``cvsdiscard
        --ignore`` instead of ``cvsdiscard``.

    ``copy``
        This maintains a ``source`` directory for source, which it updates copies to
        the build directory.  This allows Buildbot to start with a fresh directory,
        without downloading the entire repository on every build.

.. bb:step:: Bzr

.. _Step-Bzr:

Bzr
+++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.source.bzr.Bzr

bzr is a descendant of Arch/Baz, and is frequently referred to
as simply `Bazaar`. The repository-vs-workspace model is similar to
Darcs, but it uses a strictly linear sequence of revisions (one
history per branch) like Arch. Branches are put in subdirectories.
This makes it look very much like Mercurial. ::

   from buildbot.steps.source.bzr import Bzr
   factory.addStep(Bzr(mode='incremental',
                  repourl='lp:~knielsen/maria/tmp-buildbot-test'))

The step takes the following arguments:

``repourl``
    (required unless ``baseURL`` is provided): the URL at which the
    Bzr source repository is available.

``baseURL``
    (required unless ``repourl`` is provided): the base repository URL,
    to which a branch name will be appended. It should probably end in a
    slash.

``defaultBranch``
    (allowed if and only if ``baseURL`` is provided): this specifies
    the name of the branch to use when a Build does not provide one of its
    own. This will be appended to ``baseURL`` to create the string that
    will be passed to the ``bzr checkout`` command.

``mode``
``method``

    No method is needed for incremental mode.  For full mode, ``method`` can
    take the values shown below. If no value is given, it defaults to
    ``fresh``.

    ``clobber``
        This specifies to remove the ``workdir`` and make a full checkout.

    ``fresh``
        This method first runs ``bzr clean-tree`` to remove all the unversioned
        files then ``update`` the repo. This remove all unversioned files
        including those in .bzrignore.

    ``clean``
        This is same as fresh except that it doesn't remove the files mentioned
        in .bzrginore i.e, by running ``bzr clean-tree --ignore``.

    ``copy``
        A local bzr repository is maintained and the repo is copied to ``build``
        directory for each build. Before each build the local bzr repo is
        updated then copied to ``build`` for next steps.


.. bb:step:: P4

P4
++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.source.p4.P4

The :bb:step:`P4` build step creates a `Perforce <http://www.perforce.com/>`_
client specification and performs an update. ::

   from buildbot.steps.source.p4 import P4
   factory.addStep(P4(p4port=p4port,
                      p4client=WithProperties('%(P4USER)s-%(slavename)s-%(buildername)s'),
                      p4user=p4user,
                      p4base='//depot',
                      p4viewspec=p4viewspec,
                      mode='incremental',
                      ))

You can specify the client spec in two different ways. You can use the ``p4base``,
``p4branch``, and (optionally) ``p4extra_views`` to build up the viewspec, or you can utilize
the ``p4viewspec`` to specify the whole viewspec as a set of tuples.

Using p4viewspec will allow you to add lines such as:

.. code-block:: none

    //depot/branch/mybranch/...             //<p4client>/...
    -//depot/branch/mybranch/notthisdir/... //<p4client>/notthisdir/...


If you specify ``p4viewspec`` and any of ``p4base``, ``p4branch``, and/or ``p4extra_views``
you will receive a configuration error exception.


``p4base``
    A view into the Perforce depot without branch name or trailing "/...".
    Typically ``//depot/proj``.

``p4branch``
    (optional): A single string, which is appended to the p4base as follows
     ``<p4base>/<p4branch>/...`` to form the first line in the viewspec

``p4extra_views``
    (optional): a list of ``(depotpath, clientpath)`` tuples containing extra
    views to be mapped into the client specification. Both will have
    ``/...`` appended automatically. The client name and source directory
    will be prepended to the client path.

``p4viewspec``
    This will override any p4branch, p4base, and/or p4extra_views specified.
    The viewspec will be an array of tuples as follows::

        [('//depot/main/','')]

    It yields a viewspec with just:

    .. code-block:: none

        //depot/main/... //<p4client>/...

``p4viewspec_suffix``
    (optional): The ``p4viewspec`` lets you customize the client spec for a builder but, as the
    previous example shows, it automatically adds ``...`` at the end of each line.
    If you need to also specify file-level remappings, you can set the ``p4viewspec_suffix``
    to ``None`` so that nothing is added to your viewspec::

        [('//depot/main/...', '...'),
         ('-//depot/main/config.xml', 'config.xml'),
         ('//depot/main/config.vancouver.xml', 'config.xml')]

    It yields a viewspec with:

    .. code-block:: none

        //depot/main/... //<p4client>/...
        -//depot/main/config.xml //<p4client/main/config.xml
        //depot/main/config.vancouver.xml //<p4client>/main/config.xml

    Note how, with ``p4viewspec_suffix`` set to ``None``, you need to manually add ``...``
    where you need it.

``p4client_spec_options``
    (optional): By default, clients are created with the ``allwrite rmdir`` options. This
    string lets you change that.

``p4port``
    (optional): the :samp:`{host}:{port}` string describing how to get to the P4 Depot
    (repository), used as the :option:`-p` argument for all p4 commands.

``p4user``
    (optional): the Perforce user, used as the :option:`-u` argument to all p4
    commands.

``p4passwd``
    (optional): the Perforce password, used as the :option:`-p` argument to all p4
    commands.

``p4client``
    (optional): The name of the client to use. In ``mode='full'`` and
    ``mode='incremental'``, it's particularly important that a unique name is used
    for each checkout directory to avoid incorrect synchronization. For
    this reason, Python percent substitution will be performed on this value
    to replace %(slave)s with the slave name and %(builder)s with the
    builder name. The default is `buildbot_%(slave)s_%(build)s`.

``p4line_end``
    (optional): The type of line ending handling P4 should use.  This is
    added directly to the client spec's ``LineEnd`` property.  The default is
    ``local``.

``p4extra_args``
    (optional): Extra arguments to be added to the P4 command-line for the ``sync``
    command. So for instance if you want to sync only to populate a Perforce proxy
    (without actually syncing files to disk), you can do::

        P4(p4extra_args=['-Zproxyload'], ...)



.. index:: double: Gerrit integration; Repo Build Step

.. bb:step:: Repo

Repo
++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.source.repo.Repo

The :bb:step:`Repo` build step performs a `Repo <http://lwn.net/Articles/304488/>`_
init and sync.

It is a drop-in replacement for `Repo (Slave-Side)`, which should not be used anymore
for new and old projects.

The Repo step takes the following arguments:

``manifestURL``
    (required): the URL at which the Repo's manifests source repository is available.

``manifestBranch``
    (optional, defaults to ``master``): the manifest repository branch
    on which repo will take its manifest. Corresponds to the ``-b``
    argument to the :command:`repo init` command.

``manifestFile``
    (optional, defaults to ``default.xml``): the manifest
    filename. Corresponds to the ``-m`` argument to the :command:`repo
    init` command.

``tarball``
    (optional, defaults to ``None``): the repo tarball used for
    fast bootstrap. If not present the tarball will be created
    automatically after first sync. It is a copy of the ``.repo``
    directory which contains all the Git objects. This feature helps
    to minimize network usage on very big projects with lots of slaves.

``jobs``
    (optional, defaults to ``None``): Number of projects to fetch
    simultaneously while syncing. Passed to repo sync subcommand with "-j".

``syncAllBranches``
    (optional, defaults to ``False``): renderable boolean to control whether ``repo``
    syncs all branches. i.e. ``repo sync -c``

``depth``
    (optional, defaults to 0): Depth argument passed to repo init.
    Specifies the amount of git history to store. A depth of 1 is useful for shallow clones.
    This can save considerable disk space on very large projects.

``updateTarballAge``
    (optional, defaults to "one week"):
    renderable to control the policy of updating of the tarball
    given properties
    Returns: max age of tarball in seconds, or None, if we
    want to skip tarball update
    The default value should be good trade off on size of the tarball,
    and update frequency compared to cost of tarball creation

``repoDownloads``
    (optional, defaults to None):
    list of ``repo download`` commands to perform at the end of the Repo step
    each string in the list will be prefixed ``repo download``, and run as is.
    This means you can include parameter in the string. e.g:

      - ``["-c project 1234/4"]`` will cherry-pick patchset 4 of patch 1234 in project ``project``

      - ``["-f project 1234/4"]`` will enforce fast-forward on patchset 4 of patch 1234 in project ``project``

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.source.repo.RepoDownloadsFromProperties

``RepoDownloadsFromProperties`` can be used as a renderable of the ``repoDownload`` parameter
it will look in passed properties for string with following possible format:

      -  ``repo download project change_number/patchset_number``.

      -  ``project change_number/patchset_number``.

      -  ``project/change_number/patchset_number``.

All of these properties will be translated into a :command:`repo download`.
This feature allows integrators to build with several pending interdependent changes,
which at the moment cannot be described properly in Gerrit, and can only be described
by humans.

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.source.repo.RepoDownloadsFromChangeSource

``RepoDownloadsFromChangeSource`` can be used as a renderable of the ``repoDownload`` parameter

This rendereable integrates with :bb:chsrc:`GerritChangeSource`, and will
automatically use the :command:`repo download` command of repo to
download the additionnal changes introduced by a pending changeset.

.. note:: you can use the two above Rendereable in conjuction by using the class ``buildbot.process.properties.FlattenList``

for example::

   from buildbot.steps.source.repo import Repo, RepoDownloadsFromChangeSource,
   from buildbot.steps.source.repo import RepoDownloadsFromProperties
   from buildbot.process.properties import FlattenList

   factory.addStep(Repo(manifestURL='git://mygerrit.org/manifest.git',
                        repoDownloads=FlattenList([RepoDownloadsFromChangeSource(),
                                                   RepoDownloadsFromProperties("repo_downloads")
                                                   ]
                                                  )
                        ))

.. bb:step:: Gerrit

.. _Step-Gerrit:

Gerrit
++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.source.gerrit.Gerrit

This Source step is exactly like the :bb:step:`Git` checkout step , except that
it integrates with :bb:chsrc:`GerritChangeSource`, and will automatically checkout
the additional changes.

Gerrit integration can be also triggered using forced build with property named
``gerrit_change`` with values in format ``change_number/patchset_number``. This property
will be translated into a branch name.  This feature allows integrators to build with
several pending interdependent changes, which at the moment cannot be described properly
in Gerrit, and can only be described by humans.

.. bb:step:: Darcs

.. _Step-Darcs:

Darcs
+++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.source.darcs.Darcs

The :bb:step`Darcs` build step performs a `Darcs <http://darcs.net/>`_
checkout or update. ::

    from buildbot.steps.source.darcs import Darcs
    factory.addStep(Darcs(repourl='http://path/to/repo',
                          mode='full', method='clobber', retry=(10, 1)))

Darcs step takes the following arguments:

``repourl``
    (required): The URL at which the Darcs source repository is available.

``mode``

  (optional): defaults to ``'incremental'``.
  Specifies whether to clean the build tree or not.

    ``incremental``
      The source is update, but any built files are left untouched.

    ``full``
      The build tree is clean of any built files.
      The exact method for doing this is controlled by the ``method`` argument.


``method``
   (optional): defaults to ``copy`` when mode is ``full``.
   Darcs' incremental mode does not require a method.
   The full mode has two methods defined:

   ``clobber``
      It removes the working directory for each build then makes full checkout.

   ``copy``
      This first checkout source into source directory then copy the
      ``source`` directory to ``build`` directory then performs
      the build operation in the copied directory. This way we make
      fresh builds with very less bandwidth to download source. The
      behavior of source checkout follows exactly same as
      incremental. It performs all the incremental checkout behavior
      in ``source`` directory.


.. bb:step:: Monotone

.. _Step-Monotone:

Monotone
++++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.source.mtn.Monotone

The :bb:step:`Monotone <Monotone>` build step performs a `Monotone <http://www.monotone.ca/>`_
checkout or update. ::

    from buildbot.steps.source.mtn import Monotone
    factory.addStep(Darcs(repourl='http://path/to/repo',
                          mode='full', method='clobber', branch='some.branch.name',
                          retry=(10, 1)))


Monotone step takes the following arguments:

``repourl``
    the URL at which the Monotone source repository is available.

``branch``
    this specifies the name of the branch to use when a Build does not
    provide one of its own.

``progress``
    this is a boolean that has a pull from the repository use
    ``--ticker=dot`` instead of the default ``--ticker=none``.


``mode``

  (optional): defaults to ``'incremental'``.
  Specifies whether to clean the build tree or not.

    ``incremental``
      The source is update, but any built files are left untouched.

    ``full``
      The build tree is clean of any built files.
      The exact method for doing this is controlled by the ``method`` argument.


``method``

   (optional): defaults to ``copy`` when mode is ``full``.
   Monotone's incremental mode does not require a method.
   The full mode has four methods defined:

   ``clobber``
      It removes the build directory entirely then makes full clone
      from repo. This can be slow as it need to clone whole repository.

   ``clean``
      This remove all other files except those tracked and ignored by Monotone. It will remove
      all the files that appear in :command:`mtn ls unknown`. Then it will pull from 
      remote and update the working directory.

   ``fresh``
      This remove all other files except those tracked by Monotone. It will remove
      all the files that appear in :command:`mtn ls ignored` and :command:`mtn ls unknows`.
      Then pull and update similar to ``clean``

   ``copy``
      This first checkout source into source directory then copy the
      ``source`` directory to ``build`` directory then performs the
      build operation in the copied directory. This way we make fresh
      builds with very less bandwidth to download source. The behavior
      of source checkout follows exactly same as incremental. It
      performs all the incremental checkout behavior in ``source``
      directory.

.. _Source-Checkout-Slave-Side:

Source Checkout (Slave-Side)
----------------------------

This section describes the more mature slave-side source steps.  Where
possible, new users should use the master-side source checkout steps, as the
slave-side steps will be removed in a future version.  See
:ref:`Source-Checkout`.

The first step of any build is typically to acquire the source code
from which the build will be performed. There are several classes to
handle this, one for each of the different source control system that
Buildbot knows about. For a description of how Buildbot treats source
control in general, see :ref:`Version-Control-Systems`.

All source checkout steps accept some common parameters to control how
they get the sources and where they should be placed. The remaining
per-VC-system parameters are mostly to specify where exactly the
sources are coming from.

``mode``
    a string describing the kind of VC operation that is desired. Defaults
    to ``update``.

    ``update``
        specifies that the CVS checkout/update should be performed
        directly into the workdir. Each build is performed in the same
        directory, allowing for incremental builds. This minimizes
        disk space, bandwidth, and CPU time. However, it may encounter
        problems if the build process does not handle dependencies
        properly (sometimes you must do a *clean build* to make sure
        everything gets compiled), or if source files are deleted but
        generated files can influence test behavior (e.g. Python's
        .pyc files), or when source directories are deleted but
        generated files prevent CVS from removing them. Builds ought
        to be correct regardless of whether they are done *from
        scratch* or incrementally, but it is useful to test both
        kinds: this mode exercises the incremental-build style.

    ``copy``
        specifies that the CVS workspace should be maintained in a
        separate directory (called the :file:`copydir`), using
        checkout or update as necessary. For each build, a new workdir
        is created with a copy of the source tree (``rm -rf workdir;
        cp -r copydir workdir``). This doubles the disk space
        required, but keeps the bandwidth low (update instead of a
        full checkout). A full 'clean' build is performed each
        time. This avoids any generated-file build problems, but is
        still occasionally vulnerable to CVS problems such as a
        repository being manually rearranged, causing CVS errors on
        update which are not an issue with a full checkout.

        .. TODO: something is screwy about this, revisit. Is it the source
           directory or the working directory that is deleted each time?

    ``clobber``
        specifies that the working directory should be deleted each
        time, necessitating a full checkout for each build. This
        insures a clean build off a complete checkout, avoiding any of
        the problems described above. This mode exercises the
        *from-scratch* build style.

    ``export``
        this is like ``clobber``, except that the ``cvs export``
        command is used to create the working directory. This command
        removes all CVS metadata files (the :file:`CVS/` directories)
        from the tree, which is sometimes useful for creating source
        tarballs (to avoid including the metadata in the tar file).

``workdir``
    As for all steps, this indicates the directory where the build will take
    place. Source Steps are special in that they perform some operations
    outside of the workdir (like creating the workdir itself).

``alwaysUseLatest``
    if ``True``, bypass the usual `update to the last Change` behavior, and
    always update to the latest changes instead.

``retry``
    If set, this specifies a tuple of ``(delay, repeats)`` which means
    that when a full VC checkout fails, it should be retried up to
    `repeats` times, waiting `delay` seconds between attempts. If
    you don't provide this, it defaults to ``None``, which means VC
    operations should not be retried. This is provided to make life easier
    for buildslaves which are stuck behind poor network connections.

``repository``
    The name of this parameter might varies depending on the Source step you
    are running. The concept explained here is common to all steps and
    applies to ``repourl`` as well as for ``baseURL`` (when
    applicable). Buildbot, now being aware of the repository name via the
    change source, might in some cases not need the repository url. There
    are multiple way to pass it through to this step, those correspond to
    the type of the parameter given to this step:

    ``None``
        In the case where no parameter is specified, the repository url will be
        taken exactly from the Change attribute. You are looking for that one if
        your ChangeSource step has all information about how to reach the
        Change.

    string
        The parameter might be a string, in this case, this string will be taken
        as the repository url, and nothing more. the value coming from the
        ChangeSource step will be forgotten.

    format string
        If the parameter is a string containing ``%s``, then this the
        repository attribute from the :class:`Change` will be place in place of the
        ``%s``. This is useful when the change source knows where the
        repository resides locally, but don't know the scheme used to access
        it. For instance ``ssh://server/%s`` makes sense if the the
        repository attribute is the local path of the repository.

    dict
        In this case, the repository URL will be the value indexed by the
        repository attribute in the dict given as parameter.

    callable
        The callable given as parameter will take the repository attribute from
        the Change and its return value will be used as repository URL.

    .. note:: this is quite similar to the mechanism used by the
       WebStatus for the ``changecommentlink``, ``projects`` or
       ``repositories`` parameter.

``timeout``
    Specifies the timeout for slave-side operations, in seconds.  If
    your repositories are particularly large, then you may need to
    increase this  value from its default of 1200 (20 minutes).


My habit as a developer is to do a ``cvs update`` and :command:`make` each
morning. Problems can occur, either because of bad code being checked in, or
by incomplete dependencies causing a partial rebuild to fail where a
complete from-scratch build might succeed. A quick Builder which emulates
this incremental-build behavior would use the ``mode='update'``
setting.

On the other hand, other kinds of dependency problems can cause a clean
build to fail where a partial build might succeed. This frequently results
from a link step that depends upon an object file that was removed from a
later version of the tree: in the partial tree, the object file is still
around (even though the Makefiles no longer know how to create it).

`official` builds (traceable builds performed from a known set of
source revisions) are always done as clean builds, to make sure it is
not influenced by any uncontrolled factors (like leftover files from a
previous build). A `full` :class:`Builder` which behaves this way would want
to use the ``mode='clobber'`` setting.

Each VC system has a corresponding source checkout class: their
arguments are described on the following pages.

.. bb:step:: CVS (Slave-Side)

.. _Step-CVS-Slave-Side:

CVS (Slave-Side)
++++++++++++++++

The :class:`CVS <CVS (Slave-Side)>` build step performs a `CVS <http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/>`_
checkout or update. It takes the following arguments:

``cvsroot``
    (required): specify the CVSROOT value, which points to a CVS
    repository, probably on a remote machine. For example, the cvsroot
    value you would use to get a copy of the Buildbot source code is
    ``:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/buildbot``

``cvsmodule``
    (required): specify the cvs ``module``, which is generally a
    subdirectory of the CVSROOT. The `cvsmodule` for the Buildbot source
    code is ``buildbot``.

``branch``
    a string which will be used in a :option:`-r` argument. This is most
    useful for specifying a branch to work on. Defaults to ``HEAD``.

``global_options``
    a list of flags to be put before the verb in the CVS command.

``checkout_options``

``export_options``

``extra_options``
    a list of flags to be put after the verb in the CVS command.
    ``checkout_options`` is only used for checkout operations,
    ``export_options`` is only used for export operations, and
    ``extra_options`` is used for both.

``checkoutDelay``
    if set, the number of seconds to put between the timestamp of the last
    known Change and the value used for the :option:`-D` option. Defaults to
    half of the parent :class:`Build`\'s ``treeStableTimer``.

.. bb:step:: SVN (Slave-Side)

.. _Step-SVN-Slave-Side:

SVN (Slave-Side)
++++++++++++++++

The :bb:step:`SVN <SVN (Slave-Side)>` build step performs a
`Subversion <http://subversion.tigris.org>`_ checkout or update.
There are two basic ways of setting up the checkout step, depending
upon whether you are using multiple branches or not.

The most versatile way to create the ``SVN`` step is with the
``svnurl`` argument:

``svnurl``
    (required): this specifies the ``URL`` argument that will be given
    to the ``svn checkout`` command. It dictates both where the
    repository is located and which sub-tree should be extracted. In this
    respect, it is like a combination of the CVS ``cvsroot`` and
    ``cvsmodule`` arguments. For example, if you are using a remote
    Subversion repository which is accessible through HTTP at a URL of
    ``http://svn.example.com/repos``, and you wanted to check out the
    ``trunk/calc`` sub-tree, you would use
    ``svnurl="http://svn.example.com/repos/trunk/calc"`` as an argument
    to your ``SVN`` step.

The ``svnurl`` argument can be considered as a universal means to
create the ``SVN`` step as it ignores the branch information in the
SourceStamp.

Alternatively, if you are building from multiple branches, then you
should preferentially create the ``SVN`` step with the
``baseURL`` and ``defaultBranch`` arguments instead:

``baseURL``
    (required): this specifies the base repository URL, to which a branch
    name will be appended. It should probably end in a slash.

``defaultBranch``
    (optional): this specifies the name of the branch to use when a Build
    does not provide one of its own. This will be appended to
    ``baseURL`` to create the string that will be passed to the
    ``svn checkout`` command.

    It is possible to mix to have a mix of ``SVN`` steps that use
    either the ``svnurl`` or  ``baseURL`` arguments but not both at
    the same time.

``username``
    (optional): if specified, this will be passed to the :command:`svn`
    binary with a :option:`--username` option.

``password``
    (optional): if specified, this will be passed to the ``svn``
    binary with a :option:`--password` option.  The password itself will be
    suitably obfuscated in the logs.

``extra_args``
    (optional): if specified, an array of strings that will be passed as
    extra arguments to the :command:`svn` binary.

``keep_on_purge``
    (optional): specific files or directories to keep between purges,
    like some build outputs that can be reused between builds.

``ignore_ignores``
    (optional): when purging changes, don't use rules defined in
    ``svn:ignore`` properties and global-ignores in subversion/config.

``always_purge``
    (optional): if set to ``True``, always purge local changes before updating. This
    deletes unversioned files and reverts everything that would appear in a
    ``svn status``.

``depth``
    (optional): Specify depth argument to achieve sparse checkout.  Only
    available if slave has Subversion 1.5 or higher.

    If set to "empty" updates will not pull in any files or subdirectories not
    already present. If set to "files", updates will pull in any files not already
    present, but not directories. If set to "immediates", updates will pull in any
    files or subdirectories not already present, the new subdirectories will have
    depth: empty. If set to "infinity", updates will pull in any files or
    subdirectories not already present; the new subdirectories will have
    depth-infinity. Infinity is equivalent to SVN default update behavior, without
    specifying any depth argument.

If you are using branches, you must also make sure your
:class:`ChangeSource` will report the correct branch names.

.. bb:step:: Darcs (Slave-Side)

Darcs (Slave-Side)
++++++++++++++++++

The :bb:step:`Darcs <Darcs (Slave-Side)>` build step performs a
`Darcs <http://darcs.net/>`_ checkout or update.

Like :bb:step:`SVN <SVN (Slave-Side)>`, this step can either be configured to always check
out a specific tree, or set up to pull from a particular branch that
gets specified separately for each build. Also like SVN, the
repository URL given to Darcs is created by concatenating a
``baseURL`` with the branch name, and if no particular branch is
requested, it uses a ``defaultBranch``. The only difference in
usage is that each potential Darcs repository URL must point to a
fully-fledged repository, whereas SVN URLs usually point to sub-trees
of the main Subversion repository. In other words, doing an SVN
checkout of ``baseURL`` is legal, but silly, since you'd probably
wind up with a copy of every single branch in the whole repository.
Doing a Darcs checkout of ``baseURL`` is just plain wrong, since
the parent directory of a collection of Darcs repositories is not
itself a valid repository.

The Darcs step takes the following arguments:

``repourl``
    (required unless ``baseURL`` is provided): the URL at which the
    Darcs source repository is available.

``baseURL``
    (required unless ``repourl`` is provided): the base repository URL,
    to which a branch name will be appended. It should probably end in a
    slash.

``defaultBranch``
    (allowed if and only if ``baseURL`` is provided): this specifies
    the name of the branch to use when a Build does not provide one of its
    own. This will be appended to ``baseURL`` to create the string that
    will be passed to the ``darcs get`` command.

.. bb:step:: Mercurial (Slave-Side)

Mercurial (Slave-Side)
++++++++++++++++++++++

The :bb:step:`Mercurial <Mercurial (Slave-Side)>` build step performs a
`Mercurial <http://selenic.com/mercurial>`_ (aka `hg`) checkout
or update.

Branches are available in two modes: `dirname` like :bb:step:`Darcs <Darcs (Slave-Side)>`, or
`inrepo`, which uses the repository internal branches. Make sure this
setting matches your changehook, if you have that installed.

The Mercurial step takes the following arguments:

``repourl``
    (required unless ``baseURL`` is provided): the URL at which the
    Mercurial source repository is available.

``baseURL``
    (required unless ``repourl`` is provided): the base repository URL,
    to which a branch name will be appended. It should probably end in a
    slash.

``defaultBranch``
    (allowed if and only if ``baseURL`` is provided): this specifies
    the name of the branch to use when a :class:`Build` does not provide one of its
    own. This will be appended to ``baseURL`` to create the string that
    will be passed to the ``hg clone`` command.

``branchType``
    either 'dirname' (default) or 'inrepo' depending on whether
    the branch name should be appended to the ``baseURL``
    or the branch is a Mercurial named branch and can be
    found within the ``repourl``.

``clobberOnBranchChange``
    boolean, defaults to ``True``. If set and
    using inrepos branches, clobber the tree
    at each branch change. Otherwise, just
    update to the branch.

.. bb:step:: Bzr (Slave-Side)

Bzr (Slave-Side)
++++++++++++++++

bzr is a descendant of Arch/Baz, and is frequently referred to
as simply `Bazaar`. The repository-vs-workspace model is similar to
Darcs, but it uses a strictly linear sequence of revisions (one
history per branch) like Arch. Branches are put in subdirectories.
This makes it look very much like Mercurial. It takes the following
arguments:

``repourl``
    (required unless ``baseURL`` is provided): the URL at which the
    Bzr source repository is available.

``baseURL``
    (required unless ``repourl`` is provided): the base repository URL,
    to which a branch name will be appended. It should probably end in a
    slash.

``defaultBranch``
    (allowed if and only if ``baseURL`` is provided): this specifies
    the name of the branch to use when a Build does not provide one of its
    own. This will be appended to ``baseURL`` to create the string that
    will be passed to the ``bzr checkout`` command.

``forceSharedRepo``
    (boolean, optional, defaults to ``False``): If set to ``True``, the working directory
    will be made into a bzr shared repository if it is not already. Shared
    repository greatly reduces the amount of history data that needs to be
    downloaded if not using update/copy mode, or if using update/copy mode with
    multiple branches.

.. bb:step:: P4 (Slave-Side)

P4 (Slave-Side)
+++++++++++++++

The :bb:step:`P4 (Slave-Side)` build step creates a `Perforce <http://www.perforce.com/>`_
client specification and performs an update.

``p4base``
    A view into the Perforce depot without branch name or trailing "...".
    Typically ``//depot/proj/``.

``defaultBranch``
    A branch name to append on build requests if none is specified.
    Typically ``trunk``.

``p4port``
    (optional): the :samp:`{host}:{port}` string describing how to get to the P4 Depot
    (repository), used as the :option:`-p` argument for all p4 commands.

``p4user``
    (optional): the Perforce user, used as the :option:`-u` argument to all p4
    commands.

``p4passwd``
    (optional): the Perforce password, used as the :option:`-p` argument to all p4
    commands.

``p4extra_views``
    (optional): a list of ``(depotpath, clientpath)`` tuples containing extra
    views to be mapped into the client specification. Both will have
    "/..." appended automatically. The client name and source directory
    will be prepended to the client path.

``p4client``
    (optional): The name of the client to use. In ``mode='copy'`` and
    ``mode='update'``, it's particularly important that a unique name is used
    for each checkout directory to avoid incorrect synchronization. For
    this reason, Python percent substitution will be performed on this value
    to replace %(slave)s with the slave name and %(builder)s with the
    builder name. The default is `buildbot_%(slave)s_%(build)s`.

``p4line_end``
    (optional): The type of line ending handling P4 should use.  This is
    added directly to the client spec's ``LineEnd`` property.  The default is
    ``local``.

.. bb:step:: Git (Slave-Side)

Git (Slave-Side)
++++++++++++++++

The :bb:step:`Git <Git (Slave-Side)>` build step clones or updates a `Git <http://git.or.cz/>`_
repository and checks out the specified branch or revision. Note
that the buildbot supports Git version 1.2.0 and later: earlier
versions (such as the one shipped in Ubuntu 'Dapper') do not support
the ``git init`` command that the buildbot uses.

The ``Git`` step takes the following arguments:

``repourl``
    (required): the URL of the upstream Git repository.

``branch``
    (optional): this specifies the name of the branch to use when a Build
    does not provide one of its own. If this this parameter is not
    specified, and the :class:`Build` does not provide a branch, the `master`
    branch will be used.

``ignore_ignores``
    (optional): when purging changes, don't use :file:`.gitignore` and
    :file:`.git/info/exclude`.

``submodules``
    (optional): when initializing/updating a Git repository, this decides whether
    or not buildbot should consider Git submodules.  Default: ``False``.

``reference``
    (optional): use the specified string as a path to a reference
    repository on the local machine. Git will try to grab objects from
    this path first instead of the main repository, if they exist.

``shallow``
    (optional): instructs Git to attempt shallow clones (``--depth 1``).  If the
    user/scheduler asks for a specific revision, this parameter is ignored.

``progress``
    (optional): passes the (``--progress``) flag to (``git
    fetch``). This solves issues of long fetches being killed due to
    lack of output, but requires Git 1.7.2 or later.

This Source step integrates with :bb:chsrc:`GerritChangeSource`, and will automatically use
Gerrit's "virtual branch" (``refs/changes/*``) to download the additionnal changes
introduced by a pending changeset.

.. index:: double: Gerrit integration; Git (Slave-Side) Build Step

Gerrit integration can be also triggered using forced build with ``gerrit_change``
property with value in format: ``change_number/patchset_number``.

.. bb:step:: BK (Slave-Side)

BitKeeper (Slave-Side)
++++++++++++++++++++++

The :bb:step:`BK <BK (Slave-Side)>` build step performs a `BitKeeper <http://www.bitkeeper.com/>`_
checkout or update.

The BitKeeper step takes the following arguments:

``repourl``
    (required unless ``baseURL`` is provided): the URL at which the
    BitKeeper source repository is available.

``baseURL``
    (required unless ``repourl`` is provided): the base repository URL,
    to which a branch name will be appended. It should probably end in a
    slash.

.. bb:step:: Repo (Slave-Side)

Repo (Slave-Side)
+++++++++++++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.source.Repo

The :bb:step:`Repo (Slave-Side)` build step performs a `Repo <http://lwn.net/Articles/304488/>`_
init and sync.

This step is obsolete and should not be used anymore. please use: `Repo` instead

The Repo step takes the following arguments:

``manifest_url``
    (required): the URL at which the Repo's manifests source repository is available.

``manifest_branch``
    (optional, defaults to ``master``): the manifest repository branch
    on which repo will take its manifest. Corresponds to the ``-b``
    argument to the :command:`repo init` command.

``manifest_file``
    (optional, defaults to ``default.xml``): the manifest
    filename. Corresponds to the ``-m`` argument to the :command:`repo
    init` command.

``tarball``
    (optional, defaults to ``None``): the repo tarball used for
    fast bootstrap. If not present the tarball will be created
    automatically after first sync. It is a copy of the ``.repo``
    directory which contains all the Git objects. This feature helps
    to minimize network usage on very big projects.

``jobs``
    (optional, defaults to ``None``): Number of projects to fetch
    simultaneously while syncing. Passed to repo sync subcommand with "-j".

This Source step integrates with :bb:chsrc:`GerritChangeSource`, and will
automatically use the :command:`repo download` command of repo to
download the additionnal changes introduced by a pending changeset.

.. index:: double: Gerrit integration; Repo (Slave-Side) Build Step

Gerrit integration can be also triggered using forced build with following properties:
``repo_d``, ``repo_d[0-9]``, ``repo_download``, ``repo_download[0-9]``
with values in format: ``project/change_number/patchset_number``.
All of these properties will be translated into a :command:`repo download`.
This feature allows integrators to build with several pending interdependent changes,
which at the moment cannot be described properly in Gerrit, and can only be described
by humans.

.. bb:step:: Monotone (Slave-Side)

Monotone (Slave-Side)
+++++++++++++++++++++

The :bb:step:`Monotone <Monotone (Slave-Side)>` build step performs a
`Monotone <http://www.monotone.ca>`__, (aka ``mtn``) checkout
or update.

The Monotone step takes the following arguments:

``repourl``
    the URL at which the Monotone source repository is available.

``branch``
    this specifies the name of the branch to use when a Build does not
    provide one of its own.

``progress``
    this is a boolean that has a pull from the repository use
    ``--ticker=dot`` instead of the default ``--ticker=none``.

.. bb:step:: ShellCommand

ShellCommand
------------

Most interesting steps involve executing a process of some sort on the
buildslave.  The :bb:step:`ShellCommand` class handles this activity.

Several subclasses of :bb:step:`ShellCommand` are provided as starting points for
common build steps.

Using ShellCommands
+++++++++++++++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.shell.ShellCommand

This is a useful base class for just about everything you might want
to do during a build (except for the initial source checkout). It runs
a single command in a child shell on the buildslave. All stdout/stderr
is recorded into a :class:`LogFile`. The step usually finishes with a
status of ``FAILURE`` if the command's exit code is non-zero, otherwise
it has a status of ``SUCCESS``.

The preferred way to specify the command is with a list of argv strings,
since this allows for spaces in filenames and avoids doing any fragile
shell-escaping. You can also specify the command with a single string, in
which case the string is given to :samp:`/bin/sh -c {COMMAND}` for parsing.

On Windows, commands are run via ``cmd.exe /c`` which works well. However,
if you're running a batch file, the error level does not get propagated
correctly unless you add 'call' before your batch file's name:
``cmd=['call', 'myfile.bat', ...]``.

The :bb:step:`ShellCommand` arguments are:

``command``
    a list of strings (preferred) or single string (discouraged) which
    specifies the command to be run. A list of strings is preferred
    because it can be used directly as an argv array. Using a single
    string (with embedded spaces) requires the buildslave to pass the
    string to :command:`/bin/sh` for interpretation, which raises all sorts of
    difficult questions about how to escape or interpret shell
    metacharacters.

    If ``command`` contains nested lists (for example, from a properties
    substitution), then that list will be flattened before it is executed.

    On the topic of shell metacharacters, note that in DOS the pipe character
    (``|``) is conditionally escaped (to ``^|``) when it occurs inside a more
    complex string in a list of strings.  It remains unescaped when it
    occurs as part of a single string or as a lone pipe in a list of strings.

``workdir``
    All ShellCommands are run by default in the ``workdir``, which
    defaults to the :file:`build` subdirectory of the slave builder's
    base directory. The absolute path of the workdir will thus be the
    slave's basedir (set as an option to ``buildslave create-slave``,
    :ref:`Creating-a-buildslave`) plus the builder's basedir (set in the
    builder's ``builddir`` key in :file:`master.cfg`) plus the workdir
    itself (a class-level attribute of the BuildFactory, defaults to
    :file:`build`).

    For example::

        from buildbot.steps.shell import ShellCommand
        f.addStep(ShellCommand(command=["make", "test"],
                               workdir="build/tests"))

``env``
    a dictionary of environment strings which will be added to the child
    command's environment. For example, to run tests with a different i18n
    language setting, you might use ::

        from buildbot.steps.shell import ShellCommand
        f.addStep(ShellCommand(command=["make", "test"],
                               env={'LANG': 'fr_FR'}))

    These variable settings will override any existing ones in the
    buildslave's environment or the environment specified in the
    :class:`Builder`. The exception is :envvar:`PYTHONPATH`, which is
    merged with (actually prepended to) any existing
    :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` setting. The following example will prepend
    :file:`/home/buildbot/lib/python` to any existing
    :envvar:`PYTHONPATH`::

        from buildbot.steps.shell import ShellCommand
        f.addStep(ShellCommand(
                      command=["make", "test"],
                      env={'PYTHONPATH': "/home/buildbot/lib/python"}))

    To avoid the need of concatenating path together in the master config file,
    if the value is a list, it will be joined together using the right platform
    dependant separator.

    Those variables support expansion so that if you just want to prepend
    :file:`/home/buildbot/bin` to the :envvar:`PATH` environment variable, you can do
    it by putting the value ``${PATH}`` at the end of the value like
    in the example below. Variables that don't exist on the slave will be
    replaced by ``""``. ::

        from buildbot.steps.shell import ShellCommand
        f.addStep(ShellCommand(
                      command=["make", "test"],
                      env={'PATH': ["/home/buildbot/bin",
                                    "${PATH}"]}))

    Note that environment values must be strings (or lists that are turned into
    strings).  In particular, numeric properties such as ``buildnumber`` must
    be substituted using :ref:`Interpolate`.

``want_stdout``
    if ``False``, stdout from the child process is discarded rather than being
    sent to the buildmaster for inclusion in the step's :class:`LogFile`.

``want_stderr``
    like ``want_stdout`` but for :file:`stderr`. Note that commands run through
    a PTY do not have separate :file:`stdout`/:file:`stderr` streams: both are merged into
    :file:`stdout`.

``usePTY``
    Should this command be run in a ``pty``?  The default is to observe the
    configuration of the client (:ref:`Buildslave-Options`), but specifying
    ``True`` or ``False`` here will override the
    default. This option is not available on Windows.

    In general, you do not want to use a pseudo-terminal.  This is is
    *only* useful for running commands that require a terminal - for
    example, testing a command-line application that will only accept
    passwords read from a terminal. Using a pseudo-terminal brings
    lots of compatibility problems, and prevents Buildbot from
    distinguishing the standard error (red) and standard output
    (black) streams.

    In previous versions, the advantage of using a pseudo-terminal was
    that ``grandchild`` processes were more likely to be cleaned up if
    the build was interrupted or times out.  This occurred because
    using a pseudo-terminal incidentally puts the command into its own
    process group.

    As of Buildbot-0.8.4, all commands are placed in process groups,
    and thus grandchild processes will be cleaned up properly.

``logfiles``
    Sometimes commands will log interesting data to a local file, rather
    than emitting everything to stdout or stderr. For example, Twisted's
    :command:`trial` command (which runs unit tests) only presents summary
    information to stdout, and puts the rest into a file named
    :file:`_trial_temp/test.log`. It is often useful to watch these files
    as the command runs, rather than using :command:`/bin/cat` to dump
    their contents afterwards.

    The ``logfiles=`` argument allows you to collect data from these
    secondary logfiles in near-real-time, as the step is running. It
    accepts a dictionary which maps from a local Log name (which is how
    the log data is presented in the build results) to either a remote filename
    (interpreted relative to the build's working directory), or a dictionary
    of options. Each named file will be polled on a regular basis (every couple
    of seconds) as the build runs, and any new text will be sent over to the
    buildmaster.

    If you provide a dictionary of options instead of a string, you must specify
    the ``filename`` key. You can optionally provide a ``follow`` key which
    is a boolean controlling whether a logfile is followed or concatenated in its
    entirety.  Following is appropriate for logfiles to which the build step will
    append, where the pre-existing contents are not interesting.  The default value
    for ``follow`` is ``False``, which gives the same behavior as just
    providing a string filename. ::

        from buildbot.steps.shell import ShellCommand
        f.addStep(ShellCommand(
                      command=["make", "test"],
                      logfiles={"triallog": "_trial_temp/test.log"}))

    The above example will add a log named 'triallog' on the master,
    based on :file:`_trial_temp/test.log` on the slave. ::

        from buildbot.steps.shell import ShellCommand
        f.addStep(ShellCommand(
                      command=["make", "test"],
                      logfiles={"triallog": {"filename": "_trial_temp/test.log",
                           "follow": True,}}))


``lazylogfiles``
    If set to ``True``, logfiles will be tracked lazily, meaning that they will
    only be added when and if something is written to them. This can be used to
    suppress the display of empty or missing log files. The default is ``False``.


``timeout``
    if the command fails to produce any output for this many seconds, it
    is assumed to be locked up and will be killed. This defaults to
    1200 seconds. Pass ``None`` to disable.


``maxTime``
    if the command takes longer than this many seconds, it will be
    killed. This is disabled by default.

``logEnviron``
    If this option is ``True`` (the default), then the step's logfile will describe the
    environment variables on the slave.  In situations where the environment is not
    relevant and is long, it may be easier to set ``logEnviron=False``.

``interruptSignal``
    If the command should be interrupted (either by buildmaster or timeout
    etc.), what signal should be sent to the process, specified by name. By
    default this is "KILL" (9). Specify "TERM" (15) to give the process a
    chance to cleanup.  This functionality requires a 0.8.6 slave or newer.

``sigtermTime``

    If set, when interrupting, try to kill the command with SIGTERM and wait for sigtermTime seconds before firing ``interuptSignal``.
    If None, ``interruptSignal`` will be fired immediately on interrupt.

``initialStdin``
    If the command expects input on stdin, that can be supplied a a string with
    this parameter.  This value should not be excessively large, as it is
    handled as a single string throughout Buildbot -- for example, do not pass
    the contents of a tarball with this parameter.

``decodeRC``
    This is a dictionary that decodes exit codes into results value.
    e.g: ``{0:SUCCESS,1:FAILURE,2:WARNINGS}``, will treat the exit code ``2`` as
    WARNINGS.
    The default is to treat just 0 as successful. (``{0:SUCCESS}``)
    any exit code not present in the dictionary will be treated as ``FAILURE``

.. bb:step:: Configure

Configure
+++++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.shell.Configure

This is intended to handle the :command:`./configure` step from
autoconf-style projects, or the ``perl Makefile.PL`` step from perl
:file:`MakeMaker.pm`-style modules. The default command is :command:`./configure`
but you can change this by providing a ``command=`` parameter. The arguments are
identical to :bb:step:`ShellCommand`. ::

        from buildbot.steps.shell import Configure
        f.addStep(Configure())

.. bb:step:: Compile

Compile
+++++++

.. index:: Properties; warnings-count

This is meant to handle compiling or building a project written in C.
The default command is ``make all``. When the compile is finished,
the log file is scanned for GCC warning messages, a summary log is
created with any problems that were seen, and the step is marked as
WARNINGS if any were discovered. Through the :class:`WarningCountingShellCommand`
superclass, the number of warnings is stored in a Build Property named
`warnings-count`, which is accumulated over all :bb:step:`Compile` steps (so if two
warnings are found in one step, and three are found in another step, the
overall build will have a `warnings-count` property of 5). Each step can be
optionally given a maximum number of warnings via the maxWarnCount parameter.
If this limit is exceeded, the step will be marked as a failure.

The default regular expression used to detect a warning is
``'.*warning[: ].*'`` , which is fairly liberal and may cause
false-positives. To use a different regexp, provide a
``warningPattern=`` argument, or use a subclass which sets the
``warningPattern`` attribute::

    from buildbot.steps.shell import Compile
    f.addStep(Compile(command=["make", "test"],
                      warningPattern="^Warning: "))

The ``warningPattern=`` can also be a pre-compiled Python regexp
object: this makes it possible to add flags like ``re.I`` (to use
case-insensitive matching).

Note that the compiled ``warningPattern`` will have its :meth:`match` method
called, which is subtly different from a :meth:`search`. Your regular
expression must match the from the beginning of the line. This means that to
look for the word "warning" in the middle of a line, you will need to
prepend ``'.*'`` to your regular expression.

The ``suppressionFile=`` argument can be specified as the (relative) path
of a file inside the workdir defining warnings to be suppressed from the
warning counting and log file. The file will be uploaded to the master from
the slave before compiling, and any warning matched by a line in the
suppression file will be ignored. This is useful to accept certain warnings
(eg. in some special module of the source tree or in cases where the compiler
is being particularly stupid), yet still be able to easily detect and fix the
introduction of new warnings.

The file must contain one line per pattern of warnings to ignore. Empty lines
and lines beginning with ``#`` are ignored. Other lines must consist of a
regexp matching the file name, followed by a colon (``:``), followed by a
regexp matching the text of the warning. Optionally this may be followed by
another colon and a line number range. For example:

.. code-block:: none

    # Sample warning suppression file

    mi_packrec.c : .*result of 32-bit shift implicitly converted to 64 bits.* : 560-600
    DictTabInfo.cpp : .*invalid access to non-static.*
    kernel_types.h : .*only defines private constructors and has no friends.* : 51

If no line number range is specified, the pattern matches the whole file; if
only one number is given it matches only on that line.

The default warningPattern regexp only matches the warning text, so line
numbers and file names are ignored. To enable line number and file name
matching, provide a different regexp and provide a function (callable) as the
argument of ``warningExtractor=``. The function is called with three
arguments: the :class:`BuildStep` object, the line in the log file with the warning,
and the ``SRE_Match`` object of the regexp search for ``warningPattern``. It
should return a tuple ``(filename, linenumber, warning_test)``. For
example::

    f.addStep(Compile(command=["make"],
                      warningPattern="^(.\*?):([0-9]+): [Ww]arning: (.\*)$",
                      warningExtractor=Compile.warnExtractFromRegexpGroups,
                      suppressionFile="support-files/compiler_warnings.supp"))

(``Compile.warnExtractFromRegexpGroups`` is a pre-defined function that
returns the filename, linenumber, and text from groups (1,2,3) of the regexp
match).

In projects with source files in multiple directories, it is possible to get
full path names for file names matched in the suppression file, as long as the
build command outputs the names of directories as they are entered into and
left again. For this, specify regexps for the arguments
``directoryEnterPattern=`` and ``directoryLeavePattern=``. The
``directoryEnterPattern=`` regexp should return the name of the directory
entered into in the first matched group. The defaults, which are suitable for
.. GNU Make, are these::

    directoryEnterPattern = "make.*: Entering directory [\"`'](.*)['`\"]"
    directoryLeavePattern = "make.*: Leaving directory"

(TODO: this step needs to be extended to look for GCC error messages
as well, and collect them into a separate logfile, along with the
source code filenames involved).

Visual C++
++++++++++

These steps are meant to handle compilation using Microsoft compilers.
VC++ 6-12 (aka Visual Studio 2003-2013 and VCExpress9) are supported via calling
``devenv``. Msbuild as well as Windows Driver Kit 8 are supported via the
``MsBuild4`` and ``MsBuild12`` steps. These steps will take care of setting up a
clean compilation environment, parsing the generated output in real time, and
delivering as detailed as possible information about the compilation executed.

All of the classes are in :mod:`buildbot.steps.vstudio`.  The available classes are:

 * ``VC6``
 * ``VC7``
 * ``VC8``
 * ``VC9``
 * ``VC10``
 * ``VC11``
 * ``VC12``
 * ``VS2003``
 * ``VS2005``
 * ``VS2008``
 * ``VS2010``
 * ``VS2012``
 * ``VS2013``
 * ``VCExpress9``
 * ``MsBuild4``
 * ``MsBuild12``

The available constructor arguments are

``mode``
    The mode default to ``rebuild``, which means that first all the
    remaining object files will be cleaned by the compiler. The alternate
    values are ``build``, where only the updated files will be recompiled,
    and ``clean``, where the current build files are removed and no
    compilation occurs.

``projectfile``
    This is a mandatory argument which specifies the project file to be used
    during the compilation.

``config``
    This argument defaults to ``release`` an gives to the compiler the
    configuration to use.

``installdir``
    This is the place where the compiler is installed. The default value is
    compiler specific and is the default place where the compiler is installed.

``useenv``
    This boolean parameter, defaulting to ``False`` instruct the compiler
    to use its own settings or the one defined through the environment
    variables :envvar:`PATH`, :envvar:`INCLUDE`, and :envvar:`LIB`. If any of
    the ``INCLUDE`` or  ``LIB`` parameter is defined, this parameter
    automatically switches to ``True``.

``PATH``
    This is a list of path to be added to the :envvar:`PATH` environment
    variable. The default value is the one defined in the compiler options.

``INCLUDE``
    This is a list of path where the compiler will first look for include
    files. Then comes the default paths defined in the compiler options.

``LIB``
    This is a list of path where the compiler will first look for
    libraries. Then comes the default path defined in the compiler options.

``arch``
    That one is only available with the class VS2005 (VC8). It gives the
    target architecture of the built artifact. It defaults to ``x86`` and
    does not apply to ``MsBuild4`` or ``MsBuild12``. Please see ``platform`` below.

``project``
    This gives the specific project to build from within a
    workspace. It defaults to building all projects. This is useful
    for building cmake generate projects.

``platform``
    This is a mandatory argument for ``MsBuild4`` and ``MsBuild12`` specifying
    the target platform such as 'Win32', 'x64' or 'Vista Debug'. The last one
    is an example of driver targets that appear once Windows Driver Kit 8 is
    installed.

Here is an example on how to drive compilation with Visual Studio 2013::

    from buildbot.steps.vstudio import VS2013

    f.addStep(
        VS2013(projectfile="project.sln", config="release",
            arch="x64", mode="build",
               INCLUDE=[r'C:\3rd-pary\libmagic\include'],
               LIB=[r'C:\3rd-party\libmagic\lib-x64']))

Here is a similar example using "MsBuild12"::

    from buildbot.steps.vstudio import MsBuild12

    # Build one project in Release mode for Win32
    f.addStep(
        MsBuild12(projectfile="trunk.sln", config="Release", platform="Win32",
                workdir="trunk",
                project="tools\\protoc"))

    # Build the entire solution in Debug mode for x64
    f.addStep(
        MsBuild12(projectfile="trunk.sln", config='Debug', platform='x64',
                workdir="trunk"))


.. bb:step:: Robocopy

Robocopy
++++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.mswin.Robocopy

This step runs ``robocopy`` on Windows.

`Robocopy <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc733145.aspx>`_ is available in versions
of Windows starting with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. For previous versions of Windows,
it's available as part of the `Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit Tools <http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17657>`_.

::

    from buildbot.steps.mswin import Robocopy

    f.addStep(Robocopy(
                name='deploy_binaries',
                description='Deploying binaries...',
                descriptionDone='Deployed binaries.',
                source=Interpolate('Build\\Bin\\%(prop:configuration)s'),
                destination=Interpolate('%(prop:deploy_dir)\\Bin\\%(prop:configuration)s'),
                mirror=True
            ))

Available constructor arguments are:

``source``
    The path to the source directory (mandatory).

``destination``
    The path to the destination directory (mandatory).

``files``
    An array of file names or patterns to copy.

``recursive``
    Copy files and directories recursively (``/E`` parameter).

``mirror``
    Mirror the source directory in the destination directory,
    including removing files that don't exist anymore (``/MIR`` parameter).

``move``
    Delete the source directory after the copy is complete (``/MOVE`` parameter).

``exclude_files``
    An array of file names or patterns to exclude from the copy (``/XF`` parameter).

``exclude_dirs``
    An array of directory names or patterns to exclude from the copy (``/XD`` parameter).

``custom_opts``
    An array of custom parameters to pass directly to the ``robocopy`` command.

``verbose``
    Whether to output verbose information (``/V /TS /TP`` parameters).

Note that parameters ``/TEE /NP`` will always be appended to the
command to signify, respectively, to output logging to the console, use
Unicode logging, and not print any percentage progress information for
each file.


.. bb:step:: Test

Test
++++

::

    from buildbot.steps.shell import Test
    f.addStep(Test())

This is meant to handle unit tests. The default command is :command:`make
test`, and the ``warnOnFailure`` flag is set. The other arguments are identical
to :bb:step:`ShellCommand`.

.. bb:step:: TreeSize

.. index:: Properties; tree-size-KiB

TreeSize
++++++++

::

    from buildbot.steps.shell import TreeSize
    f.addStep(TreeSize())

This is a simple command that uses the :command:`du` tool to measure the size
of the code tree. It puts the size (as a count of 1024-byte blocks, aka 'KiB'
or 'kibibytes') on the step's status text, and sets a build property named
``tree-size-KiB`` with the same value.  All arguments are identical to
:bb:step:`ShellCommand`.

.. bb:step:: PerlModuleTest

PerlModuleTest
++++++++++++++

::

    from buildbot.steps.shell import PerlModuleTest
    f.addStep(PerlModuleTest())

This is a simple command that knows how to run tests of perl modules.  It
parses the output to determine the number of tests passed and failed and total
number executed, saving the results for later query.  The command is ``prove
--lib lib -r t``, although this can be overridden with the ``command``
argument.  All other arguments are identical to those for
:bb:step:`ShellCommand`.

.. bb:step:: MTR

MTR (mysql-test-run)
++++++++++++++++++++

The :bb:step:`MTR` class is a subclass of :bb:step:`Test`.
It is used to run test suites using the mysql-test-run program,
as used in MySQL, Drizzle, MariaDB, and MySQL storage engine plugins.

The shell command to run the test suite is specified in the same way as for
the :bb:step:`Test` class. The :bb:step:`MTR` class will parse the output of running the test suite,
and use the count of tests executed so far to provide more accurate completion
time estimates. Any test failures that occur during the test are summarized on
the Waterfall Display.

Server error logs are added as additional log files, useful to debug test
failures.

Optionally, data about the test run and any test failures can be inserted into
a database for further analysis and report generation. To use this facility,
create an instance of :class:`twisted.enterprise.adbapi.ConnectionPool` with
connections to the database. The necessary tables can be created automatically
by setting ``autoCreateTables`` to ``True``, or manually using the SQL
found in the :file:`mtrlogobserver.py` source file.

One problem with specifying a database is that each reload of the
configuration will get a new instance of ``ConnectionPool`` (even if the
connection parameters are the same). To avoid that Buildbot thinks the builder
configuration has changed because of this, use the
:class:`steps.mtrlogobserver.EqConnectionPool` subclass of
:class:`ConnectionPool`, which implements an equiality operation that avoids
this problem.

Example use::

    from buildbot.steps.mtrlogobserver import MTR, EqConnectionPool
    myPool = EqConnectionPool("MySQLdb", "host", "buildbot", "password", "db")
    myFactory.addStep(MTR(workdir="mysql-test", dbpool=myPool,
                          command=["perl", "mysql-test-run.pl", "--force"]))

The :bb:step:`MTR` step's arguments are:

``textLimit``
    Maximum number of test failures to show on the waterfall page (to not flood
    the page in case of a large number of test failures. Defaults to 5.

``testNameLimit``
    Maximum length of test names to show unabbreviated in the waterfall page, to
    avoid excessive column width. Defaults to 16.

``parallel``
    Value of :option:`--parallel` option used for :file:`mysql-test-run.pl` (number of processes
    used to run the test suite in parallel). Defaults to 4. This is used to
    determine the number of server error log files to download from the
    slave. Specifying a too high value does not hurt (as nonexisting error logs
    will be ignored), however if using :option:`--parallel` value greater than the default
    it needs to be specified, or some server error logs will be missing.

``dbpool``
    An instance of :class:`twisted.enterprise.adbapi.ConnectionPool`, or ``None``.  Defaults to
    ``None``. If specified, results are inserted into the database using the
    :class:`ConnectionPool`.

``autoCreateTables``
    Boolean, defaults to ``False``. If ``True`` (and ``dbpool`` is specified), the
    necessary database tables will be created automatically if they do not exist
    already. Alternatively, the tables can be created manually from the SQL
    statements found in the :file:`mtrlogobserver.py` source file.

``test_type``
    Short string that will be inserted into the database in the row for the test
    run. Defaults to the empty string, but can be specified to identify different
    types of test runs.

``test_info``
    Descriptive string that will be inserted into the database in the row for the test
    run. Defaults to the empty string, but can be specified as a user-readable
    description of this particular test run.

``mtr_subdir``
    The subdirectory in which to look for server error log files. Defaults to
    :file:`mysql-test`, which is usually correct. :ref:`Interpolate` is supported.

.. bb:step:: SubunitShellCommand

.. _Step-SubunitShellCommand:

SubunitShellCommand
+++++++++++++++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.subunit.SubunitShellCommand

This buildstep is similar to :bb:step:`ShellCommand`, except that it runs the log content
through a subunit filter to extract test and failure counts. ::

    from buildbot.steps.subunit import SubunitShellCommand
    f.addStep(SubunitShellCommand(command="make test"))

This runs ``make test`` and filters it through subunit. The 'tests' and
'test failed' progress metrics will now accumulate test data from the test run.

If ``failureOnNoTests`` is ``True``, this step will fail if no test is run. By
default ``failureOnNoTests`` is False.

.. _Slave-Filesystem-Steps:

Slave Filesystem Steps
----------------------

Here are some buildsteps for manipulating the slave's filesystem.

.. bb:step:: FileExists

FileExists
++++++++++

This step will assert that a given file exists, failing if it does not.  The
filename can be specified with a property. ::

    from buildbot.steps.slave import FileExists
    f.addStep(FileExists(file='test_data'))

This step requires slave version 0.8.4 or later.

.. bb:step:: CopyDirectory

CopyDirectory
+++++++++++++++

This command copies a directory on the slave. ::

    from buildbot.steps.slave import CopyDirectory
    f.addStep(CopyDirectory(src="build/data", dest="tmp/data"))

This step requires slave version 0.8.5 or later.

The CopyDirectory step takes the following arguments:

``timeout``
    if the copy command fails to produce any output for this many seconds, it
    is assumed to be locked up and will be killed. This defaults to
    120 seconds. Pass ``None`` to disable.

``maxTime``
    if the command takes longer than this many seconds, it will be
    killed. This is disabled by default.

.. bb:step:: RemoveDirectory

RemoveDirectory
+++++++++++++++

This command recursively deletes a directory on the slave. ::

    from buildbot.steps.slave import RemoveDirectory
    f.addStep(RemoveDirectory(dir="build/build"))

This step requires slave version 0.8.4 or later.

.. bb:step:: MakeDirectory

MakeDirectory
+++++++++++++++

This command creates a directory on the slave. ::

    from buildbot.steps.slave import MakeDirectory
    f.addStep(MakeDirectory(dir="build/build"))

This step requires slave version 0.8.5 or later.

.. _Python-BuildSteps:

Python BuildSteps
-----------------

Here are some :class:`BuildStep`\s that are specifically useful for projects
implemented in Python.

.. bb:step:: BuildEPYDoc

.. _Step-BuildEPYDoc:

BuildEPYDoc
+++++++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.python.BuildEPYDoc

`epydoc <http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/>`_ is a tool for generating
API documentation for Python modules from their docstrings. It reads
all the :file:`.py` files from your source tree, processes the docstrings
therein, and creates a large tree of :file:`.html` files (or a single :file:`.pdf`
file).

The :bb:step:`BuildEPYDoc` step will run
:command:`epydoc` to produce this API documentation, and will count the
errors and warnings from its output.

You must supply the command line to be used. The default is
``make epydocs``, which assumes that your project has a :file:`Makefile`
with an `epydocs` target. You might wish to use something like
:samp:`epydoc -o apiref source/{PKGNAME}` instead. You might also want
to add :option:`--pdf` to generate a PDF file instead of a large tree
of HTML files.

The API docs are generated in-place in the build tree (under the
workdir, in the subdirectory controlled by the :option:`-o` argument). To
make them useful, you will probably have to copy them to somewhere
they can be read. A command like ``rsync -ad apiref/
dev.example.com:~public_html/current-apiref/`` might be useful. You
might instead want to bundle them into a tarball and publish it in the
same place where the generated install tarball is placed. ::

    from buildbot.steps.python import BuildEPYDoc
    f.addStep(BuildEPYDoc(command=["epydoc", "-o", "apiref", "source/mypkg"]))

.. bb:step:: PyFlakes

.. _Step-PyFlake:

PyFlakes
++++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.python.PyFlakes

`PyFlakes <http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodPyflakes>`_ is a tool
to perform basic static analysis of Python code to look for simple
errors, like missing imports and references of undefined names. It is
like a fast and simple form of the C :command:`lint` program. Other tools
(like `pychecker <http://pychecker.sourceforge.net/>`_\)
provide more detailed results but take longer to run.

The :bb:step:`PyFlakes` step will run pyflakes and
count the various kinds of errors and warnings it detects.

You must supply the command line to be used. The default is
``make pyflakes``, which assumes you have a top-level :file:`Makefile`
with a ``pyflakes`` target. You might want to use something like
``pyflakes .`` or ``pyflakes src``. ::

    from buildbot.steps.python import PyFlakes
    f.addStep(PyFlakes(command=["pyflakes", "src"]))

.. bb:step:: Sphinx

.. _Step-Sphinx:

Sphinx
++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.python.Sphinx

`Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ is  the Python Documentation
Generator. It uses `RestructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_
as input format.

The :bb:step:`Sphinx` step will run
:program:`sphinx-build` or any other program specified in its
``sphinx`` argument and count the various warnings and error it
detects. ::

    from buildbot.steps.python import Sphinx
    f.addStep(Sphinx(sphinx_builddir="_build"))

This step takes the following arguments:

``sphinx_builddir``
   (required) Name of the directory where the documentation will be generated.

``sphinx_sourcedir``
   (optional, defaulting to ``.``), Name the directory where the
   :file:`conf.py` file will be found

``sphinx_builder``
   (optional) Indicates the builder to use.

``sphinx``
   (optional, defaulting to :program:`sphinx-build`) Indicates the
   executable to run.

``tags``
   (optional) List of ``tags`` to pass to :program:`sphinx-build`

``defines``
   (optional) Dictionary of defines to overwrite values of the
   :file:`conf.py` file.

``mode``
   (optional) String, one of ``full`` or ``incremental`` (the default).
   If set to ``full``, indicates to Sphinx to rebuild everything without
   re-using the previous build results.

.. bb:step:: PyLint

.. _Step-PyLint:

PyLint
++++++

Similarly, the :bb:step:`PyLint` step will run :command:`pylint` and
analyze the results.

You must supply the command line to be used. There is no default. ::

    from buildbot.steps.python import PyLint
    f.addStep(PyLint(command=["pylint", "src"]))

.. bb:step:: Trial

.. _Step-Trial:

Trial
+++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.python_twisted.Trial

This step runs a unit test suite using :command:`trial`, a unittest-like testing
framework that is a component of Twisted Python. Trial is used to implement
Twisted's own unit tests, and is the unittest-framework of choice for many
projects that use Twisted internally.

Projects that use trial typically have all their test cases in a 'test'
subdirectory of their top-level library directory. For example, for a package
``petmail``, the tests might be in :file:`petmail/test/test_*.py`. More
complicated packages (like Twisted itself) may have multiple test directories,
like :file:`twisted/test/test_*.py` for the core functionality and
:file:`twisted/mail/test/test_*.py` for the email-specific tests.

To run trial tests manually, you run the :command:`trial` executable and tell it
where the test cases are located. The most common way of doing this is with a
module name. For petmail, this might look like :command:`trial petmail.test`, which
would locate all the :file:`test_*.py` files under :file:`petmail/test/`, running
every test case it could find in them.  Unlike the ``unittest.py`` that
comes with Python, it is not necessary to run the :file:`test_foo.py` as a
script; you always let trial do the importing and running. The step's
``tests``` parameter controls which tests trial will run: it can be a string
or a list of strings.

To find the test cases, the Python search path must allow something like
``import petmail.test`` to work. For packages that don't use a separate
top-level :file:`lib` directory, ``PYTHONPATH=.`` will work, and will use the
test cases (and the code they are testing) in-place.
``PYTHONPATH=build/lib`` or ``PYTHONPATH=build/lib.somearch`` are also
useful when you do a ``python setup.py build`` step first. The
``testpath`` attribute of this class controls what :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` is set
to before running :command:`trial`.

Trial has the ability, through the ``--testmodule`` flag, to run only the
set of test cases named by special ``test-case-name`` tags in source files.
We can get the list of changed source files from our parent Build and provide
them to trial, thus running the minimal set of test cases needed to cover the
Changes.  This is useful for quick builds, especially in trees with a lot of
test cases.  The ``testChanges`` parameter controls this feature: if set, it
will override ``tests``.

The trial executable itself is typically just :command:`trial`, and is typically
found in the shell search path.  It can be overridden with the ``trial``
parameter.  This is useful for Twisted's own unittests, which want to use the
copy of bin/trial that comes with the sources.

To influence the version of Python being used for the tests, or to add flags to
the command, set the ``python`` parameter. This can be a string (like
``python2.2``) or a list (like ``['python2.3', '-Wall']``).

Trial creates and switches into a directory named :file:`_trial_temp/` before
running the tests, and sends the twisted log (which includes all exceptions) to
a file named :file:`test.log`. This file will be pulled up to the master where
it can be seen as part of the status output. ::

    from buildbot.steps.python_twisted import Trial
    f.addStep(Trial(tests='petmail.test'))

Trial has the ability to run tests on several workers in parallel (beginning
with Twisted 12.3.0).  Set ``jobs`` to the number of workers you want to
run.  Note that running :command:`trial` in this way will create multiple log
files (named :file:`test.N.log`, :file:`err.N.log` and :file:`out.N.log`
starting with ``N=0``) rather than a single :file:`test.log`.

This step takes the following arguments:

``jobs``
   (optional) Number of slave-resident workers to use when running the tests.
   Defaults to 1 worker.  Only works with Twisted>=12.3.0.


.. bb:step:: RemovePYCs

RemovePYCs
++++++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.python_twisted.RemovePYCs

This is a simple built-in step that will remove ``.pyc`` files from the
workdir.  This is useful in builds that update their source (and thus do not
automatically delete ``.pyc`` files) but where some part of the build
process is dynamically searching for Python modules.  Notably, trial has a bad
habit of finding old test modules. ::

    from buildbot.steps.python_twisted import RemovePYCs
    f.addStep(RemovePYCs())

.. index:: File Transfer

.. bb:step:: FileUpload
.. bb:step:: FileDownload

Transferring Files
------------------

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.transfer.FileUpload
.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.transfer.FileDownload

Most of the work involved in a build will take place on the
buildslave. But occasionally it is useful to do some work on the
buildmaster side. The most basic way to involve the buildmaster is
simply to move a file from the slave to the master, or vice versa.
There are a pair of steps named :bb:step:`FileUpload` and
:bb:step:`FileDownload` to provide this functionality. :bb:step:`FileUpload`
moves a file *up to* the master, while :bb:step:`FileDownload` moves
a file *down from* the master.

As an example, let's assume that there is a step which produces an
HTML file within the source tree that contains some sort of generated
project documentation. We want to move this file to the buildmaster,
into a :file:`~/public_html` directory, so it can be visible to
developers. This file will wind up in the slave-side working directory
under the name :file:`docs/reference.html`. We want to put it into the
master-side :file:`~/public_html/ref.html`, and add a link to the HTML
status to the uploaded file. ::

    from buildbot.steps.shell import ShellCommand
    from buildbot.steps.transfer import FileUpload

    f.addStep(ShellCommand(command=["make", "docs"]))
    f.addStep(FileUpload(slavesrc="docs/reference.html",
                         masterdest="/home/bb/public_html/ref.html",
                         url="http://somesite/~buildbot/ref.html"))

The ``masterdest=`` argument will be passed to :meth:`os.path.expanduser`,
so things like ``~`` will be expanded properly. Non-absolute paths
will be interpreted relative to the buildmaster's base directory.
Likewise, the ``slavesrc=`` argument will be expanded and
interpreted relative to the builder's working directory.

.. note:: The copied file will have the same permissions on the master
          as on the slave, look at the ``mode=`` parameter to set it
          differently.

To move a file from the master to the slave, use the
:bb:step:`FileDownload` command. For example, let's assume that some step
requires a configuration file that, for whatever reason, could not be
recorded in the source code repository or generated on the buildslave
side::

    from buildbot.steps.shell import ShellCommand
    from buildbot.steps.transfer import FileDownload

    f.addStep(FileDownload(mastersrc="~/todays_build_config.txt",
                           slavedest="build_config.txt"))
    f.addStep(ShellCommand(command=["make", "config"]))

Like :bb:step:`FileUpload`, the ``mastersrc=`` argument is interpreted
relative to the buildmaster's base directory, and the
``slavedest=`` argument is relative to the builder's working
directory. If the buildslave is running in :file:`~buildslave`, and the
builder's ``builddir`` is something like :file:`tests-i386`, then the
workdir is going to be :file:`~buildslave/tests-i386/build`, and a
``slavedest=`` of :file:`foo/bar.html` will get put in
:file:`~buildslave/tests-i386/build/foo/bar.html`. Both of these commands
will create any missing intervening directories.

Other Parameters
++++++++++++++++

The ``maxsize=`` argument lets you set a maximum size for the file
to be transferred. This may help to avoid surprises: transferring a
100MB coredump when you were expecting to move a 10kB status file
might take an awfully long time. The ``blocksize=`` argument
controls how the file is sent over the network: larger blocksizes are
slightly more efficient but also consume more memory on each end, and
there is a hard-coded limit of about 640kB.

The ``mode=`` argument allows you to control the access permissions
of the target file, traditionally expressed as an octal integer. The
most common value is probably ``0755``, which sets the `x` executable
bit on the file (useful for shell scripts and the like). The default
value for ``mode=`` is None, which means the permission bits will
default to whatever the umask of the writing process is. The default
umask tends to be fairly restrictive, but at least on the buildslave
you can make it less restrictive with a --umask command-line option at
creation time (:ref:`Buildslave-Options`).

The ``keepstamp=`` argument is a boolean that, when ``True``, forces
the modified and accessed time of the destination file to match the
times of the source file.  When ``False`` (the default), the modified
and accessed times of the destination file are set to the current time
on the buildmaster.

The ``url=`` argument allows you to specify an url that will be
displayed in the HTML status. The title of the url will be the name of
the item transferred (directory for :class:`DirectoryUpload` or file
for :class:`FileUpload`). This allows the user to add a link to the
uploaded item if that one is uploaded to an accessible place.

.. bb:step:: DirectoryUpload

Transfering Directories
+++++++++++++++++++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.transfer.DirectoryUpload

To transfer complete directories from the buildslave to the master, there
is a :class:`BuildStep` named :bb:step:`DirectoryUpload`. It works like :bb:step:`FileUpload`,
just for directories. However it does not support the ``maxsize``,
``blocksize`` and ``mode`` arguments. As an example, let's assume an
generated project documentation, which consists of many files (like the output
of :command:`doxygen` or :command:`epydoc`). We want to move the entire documentation to the
buildmaster, into a :file:`~/public_html/docs` directory, and add a
link to the uploaded documentation on the HTML status page. On the slave-side
the directory can be found under :file:`docs`::

    from buildbot.steps.shell import ShellCommand
    from buildbot.steps.transfer import DirectoryUpload

    f.addStep(ShellCommand(command=["make", "docs"]))
    f.addStep(DirectoryUpload(slavesrc="docs",
                              masterdest="~/public_html/docs",
                              url="~buildbot/docs"))

The :bb:step:`DirectoryUpload` step will create all necessary directories and
transfers empty directories, too.

The ``maxsize`` and ``blocksize`` parameters are the same as for
:bb:step:`FileUpload`, although note that the size of the transferred data is
implementation-dependent, and probably much larger than you expect due to the
encoding used (currently tar).

The optional ``compress`` argument can be given as ``'gz'`` or
``'bz2'`` to compress the datastream.

.. note:: The permissions on the copied files will be the same on the
          master as originally on the slave, see :option:`buildslave
          create-slave --umask` to change the default one.

.. bb:step:: MultipleFileUpload

Transferring Multiple Files At Once
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.transfer.MultipleFileUpload

In addition to the :bb:step:`FileUpload` and :bb:step:`DirectoryUpload` steps
there is the :bb:step:`MultipleFileUpload` step for uploading a bunch of files
(and directories) in a single :class:`BuildStep`.
The step supports all arguments that are supported by :bb:step:`FileUpload` and
:bb:step:`DirectoryUpload`, but instead of a the single ``slavesrc`` parameter
it takes a (plural) ``slavesrcs`` parameter. This parameter should either be a
list, or something that can be rendered as a list.::

    from buildbot.steps.shell import ShellCommand, Test
    from buildbot.steps.transfer import MultipleFileUpload

    f.addStep(ShellCommand(command=["make", "test"]))
    f.addStep(ShellCommand(command=["make", "docs"]))
    f.addStep(MultipleFileUpload(slavesrcs=["docs", "test-results.html"],
                                 masterdest="~/public_html",
                                 url="~buildbot"))

The ``url=`` parameter, can be used to specify a link to be displayed in the
HTML status of the step.

The way URLs are added to the step can be customized by extending the
:bb:step:`MultipleFileUpload` class. the `allUploadsDone` method is called
after all files have been uploaded and sets the URL. The `uploadDone` method
is called once for each uploaded file and can be used to create file-specific
links.::

    from buildbot.steps.transfer import MultipleFileUpload
    import os.path

    class CustomFileUpload(MultipleFileUpload):
        linkTypes = ('.html', '.txt')

        def linkFile(self, basename):
            name, ext = os.path.splitext(basename)
            return ext in self.linkTypes

        def uploadDone(self, result, source, masterdest):
            if self.url:
                basename = os.path.basename(source)
                if self.linkFile(basename):
                    self.addURL(self.url + '/' + basename, basename)

        def allUploadsDone(self, result, sources, masterdest):
            if self.url:
                notLinked = filter(lambda src: not self.linkFile(src), sources)
                numFiles = len(notLinked)
                if numFiles:
                    self.addURL(self.url, '... %d more' % numFiles)


.. bb:step:: StringDownload
.. bb:step:: JSONStringDownload
.. bb:step:: JSONPropertiesDownload

Transfering Strings
-------------------

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.transfer.StringDownload
.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.transfer.JSONStringDownload
.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.transfer.JSONPropertiesDownload

Sometimes it is useful to transfer a calculated value from the master to the
slave. Instead of having to create a temporary file and then use FileDownload,
you can use one of the string download steps.  ::

    from buildbot.steps.transfer import StringDownload
    f.addStep(StringDownload(Interpolate("%(src::branch)s-%(prop:got_revision)s\n"),
            slavedest="buildid.txt"))

:bb:step:`StringDownload` works just like :bb:step:`FileDownload` except it takes a single argument,
``s``, representing the string to download instead of a ``mastersrc`` argument. ::

    from buildbot.steps.transfer import JSONStringDownload
    buildinfo = { branch: Property('branch'), got_revision: Property('got_revision') }
    f.addStep(JSONStringDownload(buildinfo, slavedest="buildinfo.json"))

:bb:step:`JSONStringDownload` is similar, except it takes an ``o`` argument, which must be JSON
serializable, and transfers that as a JSON-encoded string to the slave.

.. index:: Properties; JSONPropertiesDownload

::

    from buildbot.steps.transfer import JSONPropertiesDownload
    f.addStep(JSONPropertiesDownload(slavedest="build-properties.json"))

:bb:step:`JSONPropertiesDownload` transfers a json-encoded string that represents a
dictionary where properties maps to a dictionary of build property ``name`` to
property ``value``; and ``sourcestamp`` represents the build's sourcestamp.

.. bb:step:: MasterShellCommand

Running Commands on the Master
------------------------------

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.master.MasterShellCommand

Occasionally, it is useful to execute some task on the master, for example to
create a directory, deploy a build result, or trigger some other centralized
processing.  This is possible, in a limited fashion, with the
:bb:step:`MasterShellCommand` step.

This step operates similarly to a regular :bb:step:`ShellCommand`, but executes on
the master, instead of the slave.  To be clear, the enclosing :class:`Build`
object must still have a slave object, just as for any other step -- only, in
this step, the slave does not do anything.

In this example, the step renames a tarball based on the day of the week. ::

    from buildbot.steps.transfer import FileUpload
    from buildbot.steps.master import MasterShellCommand

    f.addStep(FileUpload(slavesrc="widgetsoft.tar.gz",
                         masterdest="/var/buildoutputs/widgetsoft-new.tar.gz"))
    f.addStep(MasterShellCommand(command="""
        cd /var/buildoutputs;
        mv widgetsoft-new.tar.gz widgetsoft-`date +%a`.tar.gz"""))

.. note:: By default, this step passes a copy of the buildmaster's environment
   variables to the subprocess.  To pass an explicit environment instead, add an
   ``env={..}`` argument.

Environment variables constructed using the ``env`` argument support expansion
so that if you just want to prepend  :file:`/home/buildbot/bin` to the
:envvar:`PATH` environment variable, you can do it by putting the value
``${PATH}`` at the end of the value like in the example below.
Variables that don't exist on the master will be replaced by ``""``. ::

    from buildbot.steps.master import MasterShellCommand
    f.addStep(MasterShellCommand(
                  command=["make", "www"],
                  env={'PATH': ["/home/buildbot/bin",
                                "${PATH}"]}))

Note that environment values must be strings (or lists that are turned into
strings).  In particular, numeric properties such as ``buildnumber`` must
be substituted using :ref:`Interpolate`.

``interruptSignal``
   (optional) Signal to use to end the process, if the step is interrupted.

.. bb:step:: LogRenderable

LogRenderable
+++++++++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.master.LogRenderable

This build step takes content which can be renderable and logs it in a pretty-printed format.
It can be useful for debugging properties during a build.

.. index:: Properties; from steps

.. _Setting-Properties:

Setting Properties
------------------

These steps set properties on the master based on information from the slave.

.. bb:step:: SetProperty

.. _Step-SetProperty:

SetProperty
+++++++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.master.SetProperty

SetProperty takes two arguments of ``property`` and ``value`` where the ``value`` is to be assigned to the ``property`` key.
It is usually called with the ``value`` argument being specifed as a :ref:`Interpolate` object
which allows the value to be built from other property values::

    from buildbot.steps.master import SetProperty
    from buildbot.process.properties import Interpolate
    f.addStep(SetProperty(property="SomeProperty",
        value=Interpolate("sch=%(prop:scheduler)s, slave=%(prop:slavename)s")))

.. bb:step:: SetPropertyFromCommand

SetPropertyFromCommand
++++++++++++++++++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.shell.SetPropertyFromCommand

This buildstep is similar to :bb:step:`ShellCommand`, except that it captures the
output of the command into a property.  It is usually used like this::

    from buildbot.steps import shell
    f.addStep(shell.SetPropertyFromCommand(command="uname -a", property="uname"))

This runs ``uname -a`` and captures its stdout, stripped of leading
and trailing whitespace, in the property ``uname``.  To avoid stripping,
add ``strip=False``.

The ``property`` argument can be specified as a  :ref:`Interpolate`
object, allowing the property name to be built from other property values.

The more advanced usage allows you to specify a function to extract
properties from the command output.  Here you can use regular
expressions, string interpolation, or whatever you would like. In this
form, :func:`extract_fn` should be passed, and not :class:`Property`.
The :func:`extract_fn` function is called with three arguments: the exit status of the
command, its standard output as a string, and its standard error as
a string.  It should return a dictionary containing all new properties. ::

    def glob2list(rc, stdout, stderr):
        jpgs = [ l.strip() for l in stdout.split('\n') ]
        return { 'jpgs' : jpgs }
    f.addStep(SetPropertyFromCommand(command="ls -1 *.jpg", extract_fn=glob2list))

Note that any ordering relationship of the contents of stdout and
stderr is lost.  For example, given ::

    f.addStep(SetPropertyFromCommand(
        command="echo output1; echo error >&2; echo output2",
        extract_fn=my_extract))

Then ``my_extract`` will see ``stdout="output1\noutput2\n"``
and ``stderr="error\n"``.

Avoid using the ``extract_fn`` form of this step with commands that produce a great deal of output, as the output is buffered in memory until complete.

.. bb:step:: SetPropertiesFromEnv

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.slave.SetPropertiesFromEnv

SetPropertiesFromEnv
++++++++++++++++++++

Buildbot slaves (later than version 0.8.3) provide their environment variables
to the master on connect.  These can be copied into Buildbot properties with
the :bb:step:`SetPropertiesFromEnv` step.  Pass a variable or list of variables
in the ``variables`` parameter, then simply use the values as properties in a
later step.

Note that on Windows, environment variables are case-insensitive, but Buildbot
property names are case sensitive.  The property will have exactly the variable
name you specify, even if the underlying environment variable is capitalized
differently.  If, for example, you use ``variables=['Tmp']``, the result
will be a property named ``Tmp``, even though the environment variable is
displayed as :envvar:`TMP` in the Windows GUI. ::

    from buildbot.steps.slave import SetPropertiesFromEnv
    from buildbot.steps.shell import Compile

    f.addStep(SetPropertiesFromEnv(variables=["SOME_JAVA_LIB_HOME", "JAVAC"]))
    f.addStep(Compile(commands=[Interpolate("%(prop:JAVAC)s"), "-cp", Interpolate("%(prop:SOME_JAVA_LIB_HOME)s")]))

Note that this step requires that the Buildslave be at least version 0.8.3.
For previous versions, no environment variables are available (the slave
environment will appear to be empty).

.. _Setting-Buildslave-Info:

Setting Buildslave Info
-----------------------

Each buildslave has a dictionary of properties (the "buildslave info dictionary") that is persisted into the database.
This info dictionary is displayed on the "buildslave" web page and is available in Interpolate operations.

.. bb:step:: SetSlaveInfo

.. _Step-SetSlaveInfo:

SetSlaveInfo
++++++++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.master.SetSlaveInfo

``SetSlaveInfo`` is a base class to provide a facility to set values in the buildslave info dictionary.
For example::

    from buildbot.steps.master import SetSlaveInfo

    class SetSlaveFromPropInfo(SetSlaveInfo):
        name = "SetSlaveFromPropInfo"

        # override this to return the dictionary update
        def getSlaveInfoUpdate(self):
            # for example, copy a property into the buildslave dict
            update = { 
                "foo": self.getProperty("foo")
            }
            return update


.. index:: Properties; triggering schedulers

.. bb:step:: Trigger

.. _Triggering-Schedulers:

Triggering Schedulers
---------------------

The counterpart to the Triggerable described in section
:bb:Sched:`Triggerable` is the :bb:step:`Trigger` build step::

    from buildbot.steps.trigger import Trigger
    f.addStep(Trigger(schedulerNames=['build-prep'],
                      waitForFinish=True,
                      updateSourceStamp=True,
                      set_properties={ 'quick' : False }))

The ``schedulerNames=`` argument lists the :bb:sched:`Triggerable` schedulers
that should be triggered when this step is executed.  Note that
it is possible, but not advisable, to create a cycle where a build
continually triggers itself, because the schedulers are specified
by name.

If ``waitForFinish`` is ``True``, then the step will not finish until
all of the builds from the triggered schedulers have finished. Hyperlinks
are added to the waterfall and the build detail web pages for each
triggered build. If this argument is ``False`` (the default) or not given,
then the buildstep succeeds immediately after triggering the schedulers.

The SourceStamps to use for the triggered build are controlled by the arguments
``updateSourceStamp``, ``alwaysUseLatest``, and ``sourceStamps``.  If
``updateSourceStamp`` is ``True`` (the default), then step updates the
source stamps given to the :bb:sched:`Triggerable` schedulers to include
``got_revision`` (the revision actually used in this build) as ``revision``
(the revision to use in the triggered builds). This is useful to ensure that
all of the builds use exactly the same source stamps, even if other
:class:`Change`\s have occurred while the build was running. If
``updateSourceStamp`` is False (and neither of the other arguments are
specified), then the exact same SourceStamps are used. If ``alwaysUseLatest`` is
True, then no SourceStamps are given, corresponding to using the latest revisions
of the repositories specified in the Source steps. This is useful if the triggered
builds use to a different source repository.  The argument ``sourceStamps``
accepts a list of dictionaries containing the keys ``branch``, ``revision``,
``repository``, ``project``, and optionally ``patch_level``,
``patch_body``, ``patch_subdir``, ``patch_author`` and ``patch_comment``
and creates the corresponding SourceStamps.
If only one sourceStamp has to be specified then the argument ``sourceStamp``
can be used for a dictionary containing the keys mentioned above. The arguments
``updateSourceStamp``, ``alwaysUseLatest``, and ``sourceStamp`` can be specified
using properties.

The ``set_properties`` parameter allows control of the properties that are passed to the triggered scheduler.
The parameter takes a dictionary mapping property names to values.
You may use :ref:`Interpolate` here to dynamically construct new property values.
For the simple case of copying a property, this might look like ::

    set_properties={"my_prop1" : Property("my_prop1")}

The ``copy_properties`` parameter, given a list of properties to copy into the new build request, has been deprecated in favor of explicit use of ``set_properties``.

RPM-Related Steps
-----------------

These steps work with RPMs and spec files.

.. bb:step:: RpmBuild

RpmBuild
++++++++

The :bb:step:`RpmBuild` step builds RPMs based on a spec file::

    from buildbot.steps.package.rpm import RpmBuild
    f.addStep(RpmBuild(specfile="proj.spec",
            dist='.el5'))

The step takes the following parameters

``specfile``
    The ``.spec`` file to build from

``topdir``
    Definition for ``_topdir``, defaulting to the workdir.

``builddir``
    Definition for ``_builddir``, defaulting to the workdir.

``rpmdir``
    Definition for ``_rpmdir``, defaulting to the workdir.

``sourcedir``
    Definition for ``_sourcedir``, defaulting to the workdir.

``srcrpmdir``
    Definition for ``_srcrpmdir``, defaulting to the workdir.

``dist``
    Distribution to build, used as the definition for ``_dist``.

``autoRelease``
    If true, use the auto-release mechanics.

``vcsRevision``
    If true, use the version-control revision mechanics.  This uses the
    ``got_revision`` property to determine the revision and define
    ``_revision``.  Note that this will not work with multi-codebase builds.

.. bb:step:: RpmLint

RpmLint
+++++++

The :bb:step:`RpmLint` step checks for common problems in RPM packages or
spec files::

    from buildbot.steps.package.rpm import RpmLint
    f.addStep(RpmLint())

The step takes the following parameters

``fileloc``
    The file or directory to check. In case of a directory, it is recursively
    searched for RPMs and spec files to check.

``config``
    Path to a rpmlint config file. This is passed as the user configuration
    file if present.

Mock Steps
++++++++++

Mock (http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Projects/Mock) creates chroots and builds
packages in them. It populates the changeroot with a basic system
and the packages listed as build requirement. The type of chroot to build
is specified with the ``root`` parameter. To use mock your buildbot user must
be added to the ``mock`` group.

.. bb:step:: MockBuildSRPM

MockBuildSRPM Step
++++++++++++++++++

The :bb:step:`MockBuildSRPM` step builds a SourceRPM based on a spec file and
optionally a source directory::

    from buildbot.steps.package.rpm import MockBuildSRPM
    f.addStep(MockBuildSRPM(root='default', spec='mypkg.spec'))

The step takes the following parameters

``root``
    Use chroot configuration defined in ``/etc/mock/<root>.cfg``.

``resultdir``
    The directory where the logfiles and the SourceRPM are written to.

``spec``
    Build the SourceRPM from this spec file.

``sources``
    Path to the directory containing the sources, defaulting to ``.``.

.. bb:step:: MockRebuild

MockRebuild Step
++++++++++++++++

The :bb:step:`MockRebuild` step rebuilds a SourceRPM package::

    from buildbot.steps.package.rpm import MockRebuild
    f.addStep(MockRebuild(root='default', spec='mypkg-1.0-1.src.rpm'))

The step takes the following parameters

``root``
    Uses chroot configuration defined in ``/etc/mock/<root>.cfg``.

``resultdir``
    The directory where the logfiles and the SourceRPM are written to.

``srpm``
    The path to the SourceRPM to rebuild.

Debian Build Steps
------------------

.. bb:step:: DebPbuilder

DebPbuilder
+++++++++++

The :bb:step:`DebPbuilder` step builds Debian packages within a chroot built
by pbuilder. It populates the changeroot with a basic system and the packages
listed as build requirement. The type of chroot to build is specified with the
``distribution``, ``distribution`` and ``mirror`` parameter. To use pbuilder
your buildbot must have the right to run pbuilder as root through sudo. ::

    from buildbot.steps.package.deb.pbuilder import DebPbuilder
    f.addStep(DebPbuilder())

The step takes the following parameters

``architecture``
    Architecture to build chroot for.

``distribution``
    Name, or nickname, of the distribution. Defaults to 'stable'.

``basetgz``
    Path of the basetgz to use for building.

``mirror``
    URL of the mirror used to download the packages from.

``extrapackages``
    List if packages to install in addition to the base system.

``keyring``
    Path to a gpg keyring to verify the downloaded packages. This is necessary
    if you build for a foreign distribution.

``components``
    Repos to activate for chroot building.

.. bb:step:: DebCowbuilder

DebCowbuilder
+++++++++++++

The :bb:step:`DebCowbuilder` step is a subclass of :bb:step:`DebPbuilder`,
which use cowbuilder instead of pbuilder.

.. bb:step:: DebLintian

DebLintian
++++++++++

The :bb:step:`DebLintian` step checks a build .deb for bugs and policy
violations. The packages or changes file to test is specified in ``fileloc``

::

    from buildbot.steps.package.deb.lintian import DebLintian
    f.addStep(DebLintian(fileloc=Interpolate("%(prop:deb-changes)s")))

Miscellaneous BuildSteps
------------------------

A number of steps do not fall into any particular category.

.. bb:step:: HLint

HLint
+++++

The :bb:step:`HLint` step runs Twisted Lore, a lint-like checker over a set of
``.xhtml`` files.  Any deviations from recommended style is flagged and put
in the output log.

The step looks at the list of changes in the build to determine which files to
check - it does not check all files.  It specifically excludes any ``.xhtml``
files in the top-level ``sandbox/`` directory.

The step takes a single, optional, parameter: ``python``.  This specifies the
Python executable to use to run Lore. ::

    from buildbot.steps.python_twisted import HLint
    f.addStep(HLint())

MaxQ
++++

.. bb:step:: MaxQ

MaxQ (http://maxq.tigris.org/) is a web testing tool that allows you to record
HTTP sessions and play them back.  The :bb:step:`MaxQ` step runs this
framework. ::

    from buildbot.steps.maxq import MaxQ
    f.addStep(MaxQ(testdir='tests/'))

The single argument, ``testdir``, specifies where the tests should be run.
This directory will be passed to the ``run_maxq.py`` command, and the results
analyzed.

.. index:: HTTP Requests
.. bb:step:: HTTPStep
.. bb:step:: POST
.. bb:step:: GET
.. bb:step:: PUT
.. bb:step:: DELETE
.. bb:step:: HEAD
.. bb:step:: OPTIONS

HTTP Requests

Using the :bb:step:`HTTPStep` step, it is possible to perform HTTP requests in order to trigger another REST service about the progress of the build.

.. note:: This step requires the `txrequests <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/txrequests>`_ and `requests <http://python-requests.org>`_ Python libraries.

The parameters are the following:

``url``
    (mandatory) The URL where to send the request

``method``
    The HTTP method to use (out of ``POST``, ``GET``, ``PUT``, ``DELETE``,
    ``HEAD`` or ``OPTIONS``), default to ``POST``.

``params``
    Dictionary of URL parameters to append to the URL.

``data``
    The body to attach the request.
    If a dictionary is provided, form-encoding will take place.

``headers``
    Dictionary of headers to send.

``other params``
    Any other keywords supported by the ``requests`` api can be passed to this step

    .. note::

        The entire Buildbot master process shares a single Requests ``Session`` object.
        This has the advantage of supporting connection re-use and other HTTP/1.1 features.
        However, it also means that any cookies or other state changed by one step will be visible to other steps, causing unexpected results.
        This behavior may change in future versions.

When the method is known in advance, class with the name of the method can also be used.
In this case, it is not necessary to specify the method.

Example::

    from buildbot.steps.http import POST
    from buildbot.process.properties import Property
    f.addStep(
        POST( 'http://myRESTService.example.com/builds',
            data = {
            'builder': Property('buildername'),
        'buildnumber': Property('buildnumber'),
        'slavename': Property('slavename'),
        'revision': Property('got_revision'),
            }
            )
        )
