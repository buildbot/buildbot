:class:`BuildStep`\s are usually specified in the buildmaster's
configuration file, in a list that goes into the :class:`BuildFactory`.
The :class:`BuildStep` instances in this list are used as templates to
construct new independent copies for each build (so that state can be
kept on the :class:`BuildStep` in one build without affecting a later
build). Each :class:`BuildFactory` can be created with a list of steps,
or the factory can be created empty and then steps added to it using
the :meth:`addStep` method::

    from buildbot.steps import source, shell
    from buildbot.process import factory
    
    f = factory.BuildFactory()
    f.addStep(source.SVN(svnurl="http://svn.example.org/Trunk/"))
    f.addStep(shell.ShellCommand(command=["make", "all"]))
    f.addStep(shell.ShellCommand(command=["make", "test"]))

The rest of this section lists all the standard :class:`BuildStep` objects
available for use in a :class:`Build`, and the parameters which can be used to
control each.

.. _Common-Parameters:

Common Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All :class:`BuildStep`\s accept some common parameters. Some of these control
how their individual status affects the overall build. Others are used
to specify which `Locks` (see :ref:`Interlocks`) should be
acquired before allowing the step to run.

Arguments common to all :class:`BuildStep` subclasses:

``name``
    the name used to describe the step on the status display. It is also
    used to give a name to any :class:`LogFile`\s created by this step.

``haltOnFailure``
    if ``True``, a ``FAILURE`` of this build step will cause the build to halt
    immediately. Steps with ``alwaysRun=True`` are still run. Generally
    speaking, ``haltOnFailure`` implies ``flunkOnFailure`` (the default for most
    :class:`BuildStep`\s). In some cases, particularly series of tests, it makes sense
    to ``haltOnFailure`` if something fails early on but not ``flunkOnFailure``.
    This can be achieved with ``haltOnFailure=True``, ``flunkOnFailure=False``.

``flunkOnWarnings``
    when ``True``, a ``WARNINGS`` or ``FAILURE`` of this build step will mark the
    overall build as ``FAILURE``. The remaining steps will still be executed.

``flunkOnFailure``
    when ``True``, a ``FAILURE`` of this build step will mark the overall build as
    a ``FAILURE``. The remaining steps will still be executed.

``warnOnWarnings``
    when ``True``, a ``WARNINGS`` or ``FAILURE`` of this build step will mark the
    overall build as having ``WARNINGS``. The remaining steps will still be
    executed.

``warnOnFailure``
    when ``True``, a ``FAILURE`` of this build step will mark the overall build as
    having ``WARNINGS``. The remaining steps will still be executed.

``alwaysRun``
    if ``True``, this build step will always be run, even if a previous buildstep
    with ``haltOnFailure=True`` has failed.

``doStepIf``
    A step can be configured to only run under certain conditions.  To do this, set
    the step's ``doStepIf`` to a boolean value, or to a function that returns a
    boolean value or Deferred.  If the value or function result is false, then the step will
    return ``SKIPPED`` without doing anything.  Oherwise, the step will be executed
    normally.  If you set ``doStepIf`` to a function, that function should
    accept one parameter, which will be the :class:`Step` object itself.

``locks``
    a list of ``Locks`` (instances of :class:`buildbot.locks.SlaveLock` or
    :class:`buildbot.locks.MasterLock`) that should be acquired before starting this
    :class:`Step`. The ``Locks`` will be released when the step is complete. Note that this is a
    list of actual :class:`Lock` instances, not names. Also note that all Locks must have
    unique names.  See :ref:`Interlocks`.

.. _Using-Build-Properties:

.. index:: Properties

Using Build Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build properties are a generalized way to provide configuration
information to build steps; see :ref:`Build-Properties`.

Some build properties are inherited from external sources -- global
properties, schedulers, or buildslaves.  Some build properties are
set when the build starts, such as the :class:`SourceStamp` information. Other
properties can be set by BuildSteps as they run, for example the
various Source steps will set the ``got_revision`` property to the
source revision that was actually checked out (which can be useful
when the SourceStamp in use merely requested the `latest revision`:
``got_revision`` will tell you what was actually built).

In custom :class:`BuildSteps`, you can get and set the build properties with
the :meth:`getProperty`/:meth:`setProperty` methods. Each takes a string
for the name of the property, and returns or accepts an
arbitrary [#]_ object. For example::

    class MakeTarball(ShellCommand):
        def start(self):
            if self.getProperty("os") == "win":
                self.setCommand([ ... ]) # windows-only command
            else:
                self.setCommand([ ... ]) # equivalent for other systems
            ShellCommand.start(self)


.. index:: Property

.. _Property:

Property
++++++++

You can use build properties in most step paramaters.  Please file bugs for any
parameters which do not accept properties.  The simplest form is to wrap the
property name with :class:`Property`, passing an optional default
argument. ::

   from buildbot.steps.trigger import Trigger
   form buildbot.process.properties import Property

   f.addStep(Trigger(waitForFinish=False, schedulerNames=['build-dependents'], alwaysUseLatest=True,
             set_properties=@{'coq_revision': Property("got_revision")@}))

You can specify a default value by passing a ``default`` argument to
:class:`Property`. This is normally used when the property doesn't exist,
or when the value is something Python regards as ``False``. The ``defaultWhenFalse``
argument can be used to force buildbot to use the default argument only
if the parameter is not set.

.. index:: WithProperties

.. _WithProperties:

WithProperties
++++++++++++++


You can use build properties in :class:`ShellCommand`\s by using the
``WithProperties`` wrapper when setting the arguments of
the :class:`ShellCommand`. This interpolates the named build properties
into the generated shell command.  Most step parameters accept
``WithProperties``.

You can use python dictionary-style string interpolation by using
the ``%(propname)s`` syntax. In this form, the property name goes
in the parentheses::

    from buildbot.steps.shell import ShellCommand
    from buildbot.process.properties import WithProperties
    
    f.addStep(ShellCommand(
              command=["tar", "czf",
                       WithProperties("build-%s.tar.gz", "revision"),
                       "source"]))

If this :class:`BuildStep` were used in a tree obtained from Subversion, it
would create a tarball with a name like :file:`build-1234.tar.gz`.

Don't forget the extra ``s`` after the closing parenthesis! This is
the cause of many confusing errors.

The dictionary-style interpolation supports a number of more advanced
syntaxes, too.

``propname:-replacement``
    If ``propname`` exists, substitute its value; otherwise,
    substitute ``replacement``. ``replacement`` may be empty
    (``%(propname:-)s``)

``propname:~replacement``
    Like ``propname:-replacement``, but only substitutes the value
    of property ``propname`` if it is something Python regards as ``True``.
    Python considers ``None``, 0, empty lists, and the empty string to be 
    false, so such values will be replaced by ``replacement``.

``propname:+replacement``
    If ``propname`` exists, substitute ``replacement``; otherwise,
    substitute an empty string.

Although these are similar to shell substitutions, no other
substitutions are currently supported, and ``replacement`` in the
above cannot contain more substitutions.

Note: like python, you can either do positional-argument interpolation
*or* keyword-argument interpolation, not both. Thus you cannot use
a string like ``WithProperties("foo-%(revision)s-%s", "branch")``.


Callables
#########

If you need to do more complex substitution, you can pass keyword
arguments to ``WithProperties``. The value of each keyword argument
should be a function that takes one argument (the existing properties)
and returns a string value that will be used to replace that key::

    WithProperties('%(now)s', now=lambda _: time.clock())

    def determine_foo(props):
        if props.hasProperty('bar'):
            return props['bar']
        elif props.hasProperty('baz'):
            return props['baz']
        return 'qux'

    WithProperties('%(foo)s', foo=determine_foo)

Properties Objects
##################

The available methods on a properties object are those described by the
``IProperties`` interface.  Specifically:

``getProperty(propname, default=None)``

    Get a named property, returning the default value if the property is not found.

``hasProperty(propname)``

    Determine whether the named property exists.

``setProperty(propname, value, source)``

    Set a property's value, also specifying the source for this value.

``getProperties()``

    Get a Properties (:class:`buildbot.process.properties.Properties`) instance.  The
    interface of this class is not finalized; where possible, use the other
    ``IProperties`` methods.

Positional Arguments
####################

The :func:`WithProperties` function also does ``printf``\-style string
interpolation with positional arguments, using strings obtained by calling
``props.getProperty(propname)``. Note that for every ``%s`` (or
``%d``, etc), you must have exactly one additional argument to
indicate which build property you want to insert. ::

    from buildbot.steps.shell import ShellCommand
    from buildbot.process.properties import WithProperties

    f.addStep(ShellCommand(
              command=["tar", "czf",
                       WithProperties("build-%s.tar.gz", "revision"),
                       "source"]))

.. note:: like python, you can either do positional-argument interpolation
   *or* keyword-argument interpolation, not both. Thus you cannot use
   a string like ``WithProperties("foo-%(revision)s-%s", "branch")``.


.. _Common-Build-Properties:

Common Build Properties
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The following build properties are set when the build is started, and
are available to all steps.

``branch``
    This comes from the build's :class:`SourceStamp`, and describes which branch is
    being checked out. This will be ``None`` (which interpolates into
    ``WithProperties`` as an empty string) if the build is on the
    default branch, which is generally the trunk. Otherwise it will be a
    string like ``branches/beta1.4``. The exact syntax depends upon the VC
    system being used.

``revision``
    This also comes from the :class:`SourceStamp`, and is the revision of the source code
    tree that was requested from the VC system. When a build is requested of a
    specific revision (as is generally the case when the build is triggered by
    Changes), this will contain the revision specification. This is always a
    string, although the syntax depends upon the VC system in use: for SVN it is an
    integer, for Mercurial it is a short string, for Darcs it is a rather large
    string, etc.
    
    If the :guilabel:`force build` button was pressed, the revision will be ``None``,
    which means to use the most recent revision available.  This is a `trunk
    build`. This will be interpolated as an empty string.

``got_revision``
    This is set when a :class:`Source` step checks out the source tree, and
    provides the revision that was actually obtained from the VC system.
    In general this should be the same as ``revision``, except for
    trunk builds, where ``got_revision`` indicates what revision was
    current when the checkout was performed. This can be used to rebuild
    the same source code later.
    
    .. note:: For some VC systems (Darcs in particular), the revision is a
       large string containing newlines, and is not suitable for interpolation
       into a filename.

``buildername``
    This is a string that indicates which :class:`Builder` the build was a part of.
    The combination of buildername and buildnumber uniquely identify a
    build.

``buildnumber``
    Each build gets a number, scoped to the :class:`Builder` (so the first build
    performed on any given :class:`Builder` will have a build number of 0). This
    integer property contains the build's number.

``slavename``
    This is a string which identifies which buildslave the build is
    running on.

``scheduler``
    If the build was started from a scheduler, then this property will
    contain the name of that scheduler.

``repository``
    The repository of the sourcestamp for this build

``project``
    The project of the sourcestamp for this build

``workdir``

    The absolute path of the base working directory on the slave, of the current
    builder.

.. _Source-Checkout:

Source Checkout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. caution:: New source checkout steps are recently developed
    and not stable yet. If you find any bugs please report them
    `here <http://trac.buildbot.net/newticket>`_. Old source steps
    are :ref:`Source-Checkout-Old`.

.. py:module:: buildbot.steps.source

At the moment, Buildbot contains two implementations of source steps.  The new
implementation handles most of the logic on the master side, and has a simpler,
more unified approach.  The older implementation
(:ref:`Source-Checkout-Old`) handles the logic on the slave side, and
some of the classes have a bewildering array of options.

New users should, where possible, use the new implementations.  The old
implementations will be deprecated in a later release.  Old users should take
this opportunity to switch to the new implementations while both are supported
by Buildbot.

Parameters
++++++++++

All source checkout steps accept some common parameters to control how they get
the sources and where they should be placed. The remaining per-VC-system
parameters are mostly to specify where exactly the sources are coming from.

``mode``
``method``

    These two parameters specify the means by which the source is checked out.
    ``mode`` specifies the type of checkout and ``method`` tells about the
    way to implement it. ::

        factory = BuildFactory()
        from buildbot.steps.source.mercurial import Mercurial
        factory.addStep(Mercurial(repourl='path/to/repo', mode='full', method='fresh'))

    The ``mode`` parameter a string describing the kind of VC operation that is
    desired, defaulting to ``incremental``.  The options are

    ``incremental``
        Update the source to the desired revision, but do not remove any other files
        generated by previous builds.  This allows compilers to take advantage of
        object files from previous builds.  This mode is exactly same as the old
        ``update`` mode.

    ``full``
        Update the source, but delete remnants of previous builds.  Build steps that
        follow will need to regenerate all object files.

    Methods are specific to the version-control system in question, as they may
    take advantage of special behaviors in that version-control system that can
    make checkouts more efficient or reliable.

``workdir``
    like all Steps, this indicates the directory where the build will take
    place. Source Steps are special in that they perform some operations
    outside of the workdir (like creating the workdir itself).

``alwaysUseLatest``
    if True, bypass the usual ``update to the last Change`` behavior, and
    always update to the latest changes instead.

``retry``
    If set, this specifies a tuple of ``(delay, repeats)`` which means
    that when a full VC checkout fails, it should be retried up to
    ``repeats`` times, waiting ``delay`` seconds between attempts. If
    you don't provide this, it defaults to ``None``, which means VC
    operations should not be retried. This is provided to make life easier
    for buildslaves which are stuck behind poor network connections.

``repository``
    The name of this parameter might vary depending on the Source step you
    are running. The concept explained here is common to all steps and
    applies to ``repourl`` as well as for ``baseURL`` (when
    applicable). Buildbot, now being aware of the repository name via the
    :class:`ChangeSource` step might in some cases not need the repository URL. There
    are multiple way to pass it through to this step, corresponding to
    the type of the parameter given to this step:

    ``None``
        In the case where no parameter is specified, the repository URL will
        be taken directly from the Change property. This value should be used
        if your ChangeSource step has all the information about how to reach
        the Change.

    string
        The parameter might be a string. In this case, this string
        will be used as the full repository URL. The value coming from
        the ChangeSource step will be ignored.

    format string
        If the parameter is a string containing @code{%s}, then the
        repository property from the Change will be substituted in
        place of the ``%s``. This is usefull when the ChangeSource
        step knows where the repository resides locally, but doesn't
        know the scheme used to access it. For instance,
        ``ssh://server/%s`` makes sense if the repository property is
        the local path of the repository.

    dict
        In this case, the repository URL will be the value indexed by the
        repository property in the dict given as parameter.

    callable
        The callable given as parameter will take the repository property from
        the Change and its return value will be used as repository URL.

``timeout``
    Specifies the timeout for slave-side operations, in seconds.  If
    your repositories are particularly large, then you may need to
    increase this  value from its default of 1200 (20 minutes).

``logEnviron``
    If this option is true (the default), then the step's logfile will
    describe the environment variables on the slave. In situations
    where the environment is not relevant and is long, it may be
    easier to set logEnviron=False.

``env``
    a dictionary of environment strings which will be added to the
    child command's environment.

Use of :ref:`WithProperties` with string, dict and callable is supported.


.. _Step-Mercurial:

.. index:: Mercurial Checkout

Mercurial
+++++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.source.mercurial.Mercurial

The :class:`Mercurial` build step performs a `Mercurial <http://selenic.com/mercurial>`_
(aka ``hg``) checkout or update.

Branches are available in two modes: ``dirname``, where the name of the branch is
a suffix of the name of the repository, or ``inrepo``, which uses hg's
named-branches support. Make sure this setting matches your changehook, if you
have that installed.

.. code-block:: python

   factory = BuildFactory()
   from buildbot.steps.source.mercurial import Mercurial
   factory.addStep(Mercurial(repourl='path/to/repo', mode='full',
                             method='fresh', branchType='inrepo'))

The Mercurial step takes the following arguments:

``repourl``
   (required unless ``baseURL`` is provided): the URL at which the
   Mercurial source repository is available.

``baseURL``
   (required unless ``repourl`` is provided): the base repository URL,
   to which a branch name will be appended. It should probably end in a
   slash.

``defaultBranch``
   (allowed if and only if ``baseURL`` is provided): this specifies
   the name of the branch to use when a Build does not provide one of
   its own. This will be appended to ``baseURL`` to create the
   string that will be passed to the ``hg clone`` command.

``branchType``
   either 'dirname' (default) or 'inrepo' depending on whether the
   branch name should be appended to the ``baseURL`` or the branch
   is a mercurial named branch and can be found within the ``repourl``.

``clobberOnBranchChange``
   boolean, defaults to ``True``. If set and using inrepos branches,
   clobber the tree at each branch change. Otherwise, just update to
   the branch.

``mode``
``method``

   Mercurial's incremental mode does not require a method.  The full mode has
   three methods defined:


   ``clobber``
      It removes the build directory entirely then makes full clone
      from repo. This can be slow as it need to clone whole repository

   ``fresh``
      This remove all other files except those tracked by VCS. First
      it does :command:`hg purge --all` then pull/update

   ``clean``
      All the files which are tracked by Mercurial and listed ignore
      files are not deleted. Remaining all other files will be deleted
      before pull/update. This is equivalent to :command:`hg purge`
      then pull/update. 


.. _Step-Git:

.. index:: Git Checkout

Git
+++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.source.git.Git

The ``Git`` build step clones or updates a `Git <http://git.or.cz/>`_
repository and checks out the specified branch or revision. Note that
the buildbot supports Git version 1.2.0 and later: earlier versions
(such as the one shipped in Ubuntu 'Dapper') do not support the
:command:`git init` command that the buildbot uses.

The Git step takes the following arguments:

``repourl``
   (required): the URL of the upstream Git repository.

``branch``
   (optional): this specifies the name of the branch to use when a
   Build does not provide one of its own. If this this parameter is
   not specified, and the Build does not provide a branch, the
   ``master`` branch will be used.

``submodules``
   (optional): when initializing/updating a Git repository, this
   decides whether or not buildbot should consider git submodules.
   Default: ``False``.

``shallow``
   (optional): instructs git to attempt shallow clones (``--depth
   1``). If the user/scheduler asks for a specific revision, this
   parameter is ignored. 

``progress``
   (optional): passes the (``--progress``) flag to (:command:`git
   fetch`). This solves issues of long fetches being killed due to
   lack of output, but requires Git 1.7.2 or later.

``retryFetch``
   (optional): this value defaults to ``False``. In any case if
   fetch fails buildbot retries to fetch again instead of failing the
   entire source checkout.

``clobberOnFailure``
   (optional): defaults to ``False``. If a fetch or full clone
   fails we can checkout source removing everything. This way new
   repository will be cloned. If retry fails it fails the source
   checkout step.

``mode``
``method``

   Git's incremental mode does not require a method.  The full mode has
   four methods defined:


   ``clobber``
      It removes the build directory entirely then makes full clone
      from repo. This can be slow as it need to clone whole repository

   ``fresh``
      This remove all other files except those tracked by Git. First
      it does :command:`git clean -d -f -x` then fetch/checkout to a
      specified revision(if any). This option is equal to update mode
      with ``ignore_ignores=True`` in old steps.

   ``clean``
      All the files which are tracked by Git and listed ignore files
      are not deleted. Remaining all other files will be deleted
      before fetch/checkout. This is equivalent to :command:`git clean
      -d -f` then fetch. This is equivalent to
      ``ignore_ignores=False`` in old steps.

   ``copy``
      This first checkout source into source directory then copy the
      ``source`` directory to ``build`` directory then performs the
      build operation in the copied directory. This way we make fresh
      builds with very less bandwidth to download source. The behavior
      of source checkout follows exactly same as incremental. It
      performs all the incremental checkout behavior in ``source``
      directory.

.. _Step-SVN:

.. index::
   SVN Checkout 
   SVN
   Build Steps; SVN

SVN
+++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.source.svn.SVN


The :class:`SVN` build step performs a `Subversion <http://subversion.tigris.org>`_
checkout or update. There are two
basic ways of setting up the checkout step, depending upon whether you
are using multiple branches or not.

The most versatile way to create the :class:`SVN` step is with the
``svnurl`` argument:

``svnurl``
   (required): this specifies the ``URL`` argument that will be
   given to the :command:`svn checkout` command. It dictates both where
   the repository is located and which sub-tree should be
   extracted. In this respect, it is like a combination of the CVS
   ``cvsroot`` and ``cvsmodule`` arguments. For example, if you
   are using a remote Subversion repository which is accessible
   through HTTP at a URL of ``http://svn.example.com/repos``, and
   you wanted to check out the ``trunk/calc`` sub-tree, you would
   use ``svnurl="http://svn.example.com/repos/trunk/calc"`` as an
   argument to your :class:`SVN` step.

The ``svnurl`` argument can be considered as a universal means to
create the :class:`SVN` step as it ignores the branch information in the
:class:`SourceStamp`.

Alternatively, if you are building from multiple branches, then you
should preferentially create the :class:`SVN` step with the
``baseURL`` and ``defaultBranch`` arguments instead:

``baseURL``
   (required): this specifies the base repository URL, to which a
   branch name will be appended. Alternatively, ``baseURL`` can
   contain a ``%%BRANCH%%`` placeholder, which will be replaced with
   the branch name. ``baseURL`` should probably end in a slash.

   For flexibility, ``baseURL`` may contain a ``%%BRANCH%%``
   placeholder, which will be replaced either by the branch in the
   SourceStamp or the default specified in ``defaultBranch``. ::

      source.SVN( mode='update',
                  baseURL='svn://svn.example.org/svn/%%BRANCH%%/myproject',
                  defaultBranch='trunk' )

``defaultBranch``
   (optional): this specifies the name of the branch to use when a
   Build does not provide one of its own. This is a string that will
   be appended to ``baseURL`` to create the URL that will be passed to
   the :command:`svn checkout` command. If you use ``baseURL``
   without specifying ``defaultBranch`` every :class:`ChangeStamp`
   must come with a valid (not None) ``branch``.

   It is possible to mix to have a mix of :class:`SVN` steps that use
   either the ``svnurl` or ``baseURL`` arguments but not both at
   the same time.

``username``
   (optional): if specified, this will be passed to the ``svn``
   binary with a ``--username`` option. 

``password``
   (optional): if specified, this will be passed to the ``svn`` binary
   with a ``--password`` option. The password itself will be suitably
   obfuscated in the logs.

``extra_args``
   (optional): if specified, an array of strings that will be passed
   as extra arguments to the ``svn`` binary.

``keep_on_purge``
   (optional): specific files or directories to keep between purges,
   like some build outputs that can be reused between builds. 

``depth``
   (optional): Specify depth argument to achieve sparse checkout.
   Only available if slave has Subversion 1.5 or higher. 

   If set to ``empty`` updates will not pull in any files or
   subdirectories not already present. If set to ``files``, updates will
   pull in any files not already present, but not directories.  If set
   to ``immediates``, updates will pull in any files or subdirectories
   not already present, the new subdirectories will have depth: empty.
   If set to ``infinity``, updates will pull in any files or
   subdirectories not already present; the new subdirectories will
   have depth-infinity. Infinity is equivalent to SVN default update
   behavior, without specifying any depth argument. 

``mode``
``method``

   SVN's incremental mode does not require a method.  The full mode
   has four methods defined:

  ``clobber``
      It removes the working directory for each build then makes full checkout.

   ``fresh``
      This always always purges local changes before updating. This
      deletes unversioned files and reverts everything that would
      appear in a :command:`svn status --no-ignore`. This is equivalent
      to the old update mode with ``always_purge``. 

   ``clean``
      This is same as fresh except that it deletes all unversioned
      files generated by :command:`svn status`.

   ``copy``
      This first checkout source into source directory then copy the
      ``source`` directory to ``build`` directory then performs
      the build operation in the copied directory. This way we make
      fresh builds with very less bandwidth to download source. The
      behavior of source checkout follows exactly same as
      incremental. It performs all the incremental checkout behavior
      in ``source`` directory.

If you are using branches, you must also make sure your
``ChangeSource`` will report the correct branch names.

branch example
##############

Let's suppose that the ``MyProject`` repository uses branches for the
trunk, for various users' individual development efforts, and for
several new features that will require some amount of work (involving
multiple developers) before they are ready to merge onto the trunk.
Such a repository might be organized as follows::

   svn://svn.example.org/MyProject/trunk
   svn://svn.example.org/MyProject/branches/User1/foo
   svn://svn.example.org/MyProject/branches/User1/bar
   svn://svn.example.org/MyProject/branches/User2/baz
   svn://svn.example.org/MyProject/features/newthing
   svn://svn.example.org/MyProject/features/otherthing

Further assume that we want the Buildbot to run tests against the
trunk and against all the feature branches (i.e., do a
checkout/compile/build of branch X when a file has been changed on
branch X, when X is in the set [trunk, features/newthing,
features/otherthing]). We do not want the Buildbot to automatically
build any of the user branches, but it should be willing to build a
user branch when explicitly requested (most likely by the user who
owns that branch).

There are three things that need to be set up to accommodate this
system. The first is a ChangeSource that is capable of identifying the
branch which owns any given file. This depends upon a user-supplied
function, in an external program that runs in the SVN commit hook and
connects to the buildmaster's :class:`PBChangeSource` over a TCP
connection. (you can use the ``buildbot sendchange`` utility
for this purpose, but you will still need an external program to
decide what value should be passed to the ``--branch=`` argument).
For example, a change to a file with the SVN URL of
``svn://svn.example.org/MyProject/features/newthing/src/foo.c`` should
be broken down into a :class:`Change` instance with
``branch='features/newthing'`` and ``file='src/foo.c'``.

The second piece is an :class:`AnyBranchScheduler` which will pay
attention to the desired branches. It will not pay attention to the
user branches, so it will not automatically start builds in response
to changes there. The AnyBranchScheduler class requires you to
explicitly list all the branches you want it to use, but it would not
be difficult to write a subclass which used
``branch.startswith('features/'`` to remove the need for this
explicit list. Or, if you want to build user branches too, you can use
AnyBranchScheduler with ``branches=None`` to indicate that you want
it to pay attention to all branches.

The third piece is an :class:`SVN` checkout step that is configured to
handle the branches correctly, with a ``baseURL`` value that
matches the way the ChangeSource splits each file's URL into base,
branch, and file. ::

   from buildbot.changes.pb import PBChangeSource
   from buildbot.scheduler import AnyBranchScheduler
   from buildbot.process import source, factory
   from buildbot.steps import source, shell

   c['change_source'] = PBChangeSource()
   s1 = AnyBranchScheduler('main',
                           ['trunk', 'features/newthing',
                            'features/otherthing'], 
                           10*60, ['test-i386', 'test-ppc'])
   c['schedulers'] = [s1]

   f = factory.BuildFactory()
   f.addStep(source.SVN(mode='update',
                        baseURL='svn://svn.example.org/MyProject/',
                        defaultBranch='trunk'))
   f.addStep(shell.Compile(command="make all"))
   f.addStep(shell.Test(command="make test"))

   c['builders'] = [
     {'name':'test-i386', 'slavename':'bot-i386',
      'builddir':'test-i386', 'factory':f },
     {'name':'test-ppc', 'slavename':'bot-ppc', 'builddir':'test-ppc',
      'factory':f },
   ]

In this example, when a change arrives with a ``branch`` attribute of
``trunk``, the resulting build will have a SVN step that concatenates
``svn://svn.example.org/MyProject/`` (the baseURL) with ``trunk`` (the branch
name) to get the correct svn command. If the ``newthing`` branch has a change
to ``src/foo.c``, then the SVN step will concatenate
``svn://svn.example.org/MyProject/`` with ``features/newthing`` to get the
svnurl for checkout.

.. _Step-CVS:

.. index::
   CVS Checkout 
   CVS
   Build Steps; CVS

CVS
+++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.source.cvs.CVS

The :class:`CVS` build step performs a `CVS <http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/>`_
heckout or update. It takes the following arguments:

``cvsroot``

    (required): specify the CVSROOT value, which points to a CVS repository,
    probably on a remote machine. For example, if Buildbot was hosted in CVS
    then the cvsroot value you would use to get a copy of the Buildbot source
    code might be
    ``:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/buildbot``.

``cvsmodule``
    (required): specify the cvs ``module``, which is generally a
    subdirectory of the CVSROOT. The cvsmodule for the Buildbot source code is
    ``buildbot``.

``branch``
    a string which will be used in a ``-r`` argument. This is most useful for
    specifying a branch to work on. Defaults to ``HEAD``.

``global_options``
    a list of flags to be put before the argument ``checkout`` in the CVS
    command.

``extra_options``
    a list of flags to be put after the ``checkout`` in the CVS command.

``mode``
``method``

    No method is needed for incremental mode.  For full mode, ``method`` can
    take the values shown below. If no value is given, it defaults to
    ``fresh``.

``clobber``
    This specifies to remove the ``workdir`` and make a full checkout.

``fresh``
    This method first runs ``cvsdisard`` in the build directory, then updates
    it.  This requires ``cvsdiscard`` which is a part of the cvsutil package.

``clean``
    This method is the same as ``method='fresh'``, but it runs ``cvsdiscard
    --ignore`` instead of ``cvsdiscard``.

``copy``
    This maintains a ``source`` directory for source, which it updates copies to
    the build directory.  This allows Buildbot to start with a fresh directory,
    without downloading the entire repository on every build.

.. _Step-Bzr:

.. index::
   Bzr
   Build Steps; Bzr

Bzr
+++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.source.bzr.Bzr

bzr is a descendant of Arch/Baz, and is frequently referred to
as simply `Bazaar`. The repository-vs-workspace model is similar to
Darcs, but it uses a strictly linear sequence of revisions (one
history per branch) like Arch. Branches are put in subdirectories.
This makes it look very much like Mercurial. It takes the following
arguments:

``repourl``
    (required unless ``baseURL`` is provided): the URL at which the
    Bzr source repository is available.

``baseURL``
    (required unless ``repourl`` is provided): the base repository URL,
    to which a branch name will be appended. It should probably end in a
    slash.

``defaultBranch``
    (allowed if and only if ``baseURL`` is provided): this specifies
    the name of the branch to use when a Build does not provide one of its
    own. This will be appended to ``baseURL`` to create the string that
    will be passed to the ``bzr checkout`` command.

``mode``
``method``

    No method is needed for incremental mode.  For full mode, ``method`` can
    take the values shown below. If no value is given, it defaults to
    ``fresh``.

``clobber``
    This specifies to remove the ``workdir`` and make a full checkout.

``fresh``
    This method first runs ``bzr clean-tree`` to remove all the unversioned
    files then ``update`` the repo. This remove all unversioned files
    including those in .bzrignore.

``clean``
    This is same as fresh except that it doesn't remove the files mentioned
    in .bzrginore i.e, by running ``bzr clean-tree --ignore``.

``copy``
    A local bzr repository is maintained and the repo is copied to ``build``
    directory for each build. Before each build the local bzr repo is
    updated then copied to ``build`` for next steps.


.. _Source-Checkout-Old:

Source Checkout (Old)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step of any build is typically to acquire the source code
from which the build will be performed. There are several classes to
handle this, one for each of the different source control system that
Buildbot knows about. For a description of how Buildbot treats source
control in general, see :ref:`Version-Control-Systems`.

All source checkout steps accept some common parameters to control how
they get the sources and where they should be placed. The remaining
per-VC-system parameters are mostly to specify where exactly the
sources are coming from.

``mode``
    a string describing the kind of VC operation that is desired. Defaults
    to ``update``.

    ``update``
        specifies that the CVS checkout/update should be performed
        directly into the workdir. Each build is performed in the same
        directory, allowing for incremental builds. This minimizes
        disk space, bandwidth, and CPU time. However, it may encounter
        problems if the build process does not handle dependencies
        properly (sometimes you must do a *clean build* to make sure
        everything gets compiled), or if source files are deleted but
        generated files can influence test behavior (e.g. python's
        .pyc files), or when source directories are deleted but
        generated files prevent CVS from removing them. Builds ought
        to be correct regardless of whether they are done *from
        scratch* or incrementally, but it is useful to test both
        kinds: this mode exercises the incremental-build style.

    ``copy``
        specifies that the CVS workspace should be maintained in a
        separate directory (called the :file:`copydir`), using
        checkout or update as necessary. For each build, a new workdir
        is created with a copy of the source tree (``rm -rf workdir;
        cp -r copydir workdir``). This doubles the disk space
        required, but keeps the bandwidth low (update instead of a
        full checkout). A full 'clean' build is performed each
        time. This avoids any generated-file build problems, but is
        still occasionally vulnerable to CVS problems such as a
        repository being manually rearranged, causing CVS errors on
        update which are not an issue with a full checkout.

        .. TODO: something is screwy about this, revisit. Is it the source
           directory or the working directory that is deleted each time?

    ``clobber``
        specifies that the working directory should be deleted each
        time, necessitating a full checkout for each build. This
        insures a clean build off a complete checkout, avoiding any of
        the problems described above. This mode exercises the
        *from-scratch* build style.

    ``export``
        this is like ``clobber``, except that the ``cvs export``
        command is used to create the working directory. This command
        removes all CVS metadata files (the :file:`CVS/` directories)
        from the tree, which is sometimes useful for creating source
        tarballs (to avoid including the metadata in the tar file).

``workdir``
    like all :class:`Step`\s, this indicates the directory where the build will take
    place. Source Steps are special in that they perform some operations
    outside of the workdir (like creating the workdir itself).

``alwaysUseLatest``
    if ``True``, bypass the usual `update to the last Change` behavior, and
    always update to the latest changes instead.

``retry``
    If set, this specifies a tuple of ``(delay, repeats)`` which means
    that when a full VC checkout fails, it should be retried up to
    `repeats` times, waiting `delay` seconds between attempts. If
    you don't provide this, it defaults to ``None``, which means VC
    operations should not be retried. This is provided to make life easier
    for buildslaves which are stuck behind poor network connections.

``repository``
    The name of this parameter might varies depending on the Source step you
    are running. The concept explained here is common to all steps and
    applies to ``repourl`` as well as for ``baseURL`` (when
    aplicable). Buildbot, now being aware of the repository name via the
    :class:`ChangeSource` step might in some cases not need the repository url. There
    are multiple way to pass it through to this step, those correspond to
    the type of the parameter given to this step:

    ``None``
        In the case where no paraneter is specified, the repository url will be
        taken exactly from the Change property. You are looking for that one if
        your ChangeSource step has all informations about how to reach the
        Change.
    
    ``string``
        The parameter might be a string, in this case, this string will be taken
        as the repository url, and nothing more. the value coming from the
        ChangeSource step will be forgotten.
    
    ``format string``
        If the parameter is a string containing ``%s``, then this the
        repository property from the :class:`Change` will be place in place of the
        ``%s``. This is usefull when the :class:`ChangeSource` step knows where the
        repository resides locally, but don't know the scheme used to access
        it. For instance ``ssh://server/%s`` makes sense if the the
        repository property is the local path of the repository.
    
    ``dict``
        In this case, the repository URL will be the value indexed by the
        repository property in the dict given as parameter.
    
    ``callable``
        The callable given as parameter will take the repository property from
        the Change and its return value will be used as repository URL.

    .. note:: this is quite similar to the mechanism used by the
       WebStatus for the ``changecommentlink``, ``projects`` or
       ``repositories`` parameter.

``timeout``
    Specifies the timeout for slave-side operations, in seconds.  If
    your repositories are particularly large, then you may need to
    increase this  value from its default of 1200 (20 minutes).


My habit as a developer is to do a ``cvs update`` and :command:`make` each
morning. Problems can occur, either because of bad code being checked in, or
by incomplete dependencies causing a partial rebuild to fail where a
complete from-scratch build might succeed. A quick Builder which emulates
this incremental-build behavior would use the ``mode='update'``
setting.

On the other hand, other kinds of dependency problems can cause a clean
build to fail where a partial build might succeed. This frequently results
from a link step that depends upon an object file that was removed from a
later version of the tree: in the partial tree, the object file is still
around (even though the Makefiles no longer know how to create it).

`official` builds (traceable builds performed from a known set of
source revisions) are always done as clean builds, to make sure it is
not influenced by any uncontrolled factors (like leftover files from a
previous build). A `full` :class:`Builder` which behaves this way would want
to use the ``mode='clobber'`` setting.

Each VC system has a corresponding source checkout class: their
arguments are described on the following pages.

.. _Step-CVS-Old:

CVS (Old)
+++++++++


The :class:`CVS` build step performs a `CVS <http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/>`_
checkout or update. It takes the following arguments:

``cvsroot``
    (required): specify the CVSROOT value, which points to a CVS
    repository, probably on a remote machine. For example, the cvsroot
    value you would use to get a copy of the Buildbot source code is
    ``:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/buildbot``

``cvsmodule``
    (required): specify the cvs @code{module}, which is generally a
    subdirectory of the CVSROOT. The `cvsmodule` for the Buildbot source
    code is ``buildbot``.

``branch``
    a string which will be used in a :option:`-r` argument. This is most
    useful for specifying a branch to work on. Defaults to ``HEAD``.

``global_options``
    a list of flags to be put before the verb in the CVS command.

``checkout_options``

``export_options``

``extra_options``
    a list of flags to be put after the verb in the CVS command.
    ``checkout_options`` is only used for checkout operations,
    ``export_options`` is only used for export operations, and
    ``extra_options`` is used for both.

``checkoutDelay``
    if set, the number of seconds to put between the timestamp of the last
    known Change and the value used for the :option:`-D` option. Defaults to
    half of the parent :class:`Build`\'s ``treeStableTimer``.

.. _Step-SVN-Old:

SVN (Old)
+++++++++

The :class:`SVN` build step performs a
`Subversion <http://subversion.tigris.org>`_ checkout or update.
There are two basic ways of setting up the checkout step, depending
upon whether you are using multiple branches or not.

The most versatile way to create the :class:`SVN` step is with the
``svnurl`` argument:

``svnurl``
    (required): this specifies the ``URL`` argument that will be given
    to the ``svn checkout`` command. It dictates both where the
    repository is located and which sub-tree should be extracted. In this
    respect, it is like a combination of the CVS ``cvsroot`` and
    ``cvsmodule`` arguments. For example, if you are using a remote
    Subversion repository which is accessible through HTTP at a URL of
    ``http://svn.example.com/repos``, and you wanted to check out the
    ``trunk/calc`` sub-tree, you would use
    ``svnurl="http://svn.example.com/repos/trunk/calc"`` as an argument
    to your :class:`SVN` step.

The ``svnurl`` argument can be considered as a universal means to
create the :class:`SVN` step as it ignores the branch information in the
SourceStamp.

Alternatively, if you are building from multiple branches, then you
should preferentially create the :class:`SVN` step with the
``baseURL`` and ``defaultBranch`` arguments instead:

``baseURL``
    (required): this specifies the base repository URL, to which a branch
    name will be appended. It should probably end in a slash.

``defaultBranch``
    (optional): this specifies the name of the branch to use when a Build
    does not provide one of its own. This will be appended to
    ``baseURL`` to create the string that will be passed to the
    ``svn checkout`` command.

    It is possible to mix to have a mix of :class:`SVN` steps that use
    either the ``svnurl`` or  ``baseURL`` arguments but not both at
    the same time.

``username``
    (optional): if specified, this will be passed to the :command:`svn`
    binary with a :option:`--username` option.

``password``
    (optional): if specified, this will be passed to the @code{svn}
    binary with a :option:`--password` option.  The password itself will be
    suitably obfuscated in the logs.

``extra_args``
    (optional): if specified, an array of strings that will be passed as
    extra arguments to the :command:`svn` binary.

``keep_on_purge``
    (optional): specific files or directories to keep between purges,
    like some build outputs that can be reused between builds.

``ignore_ignores``
    (optional): when purging changes, don't use rules defined in
    ``svn:ignore`` properties and global-ignores in subversion/config.

``always_purge``
    (optional): if set to ``True``, always purge local changes before updating. This
    deletes unversioned files and reverts everything that would appear in a
    ``svn status``.

``depth``
    (optional): Specify depth argument to achieve sparse checkout.  Only
    available if slave has Subversion 1.5 or higher.

    If set to "empty" updates will not pull in any files or subdirectories not
    already present. If set to "files", updates will pull in any files not already
    present, but not directories. If set to "immediates", updates willl pull in any
    files or subdirectories not already present, the new subdirectories will have
    depth: empty. If set to "infinity", updates will pull in any files or
    subdirectories not already present; the new subdirectories will have
    depth-infinity. Infinity is equivalent to SVN default update behavior, without
    specifying any depth argument.


If you are using branches, you must also make sure your
:class:`ChangeSource` will report the correct branch names.

branch example
##############

Let's suppose that the `MyProject` repository uses branches for the
trunk, for various users' individual development efforts, and for
several new features that will require some amount of work (involving
multiple developers) before they are ready to merge onto the trunk.
Such a repository might be organized as follows:

.. code-block:: none

    svn://svn.example.org/MyProject/trunk
    svn://svn.example.org/MyProject/branches/User1/foo
    svn://svn.example.org/MyProject/branches/User1/bar
    svn://svn.example.org/MyProject/branches/User2/baz
    svn://svn.example.org/MyProject/features/newthing
    svn://svn.example.org/MyProject/features/otherthing

Further assume that we want the Buildbot to run tests against the
trunk and against all the feature branches (i.e., do a
checkout/compile/build of branch *X* when a file has been changed on
branch *X*, when *X* is in the set [trunk, features/newthing,
features/otherthing]). We do not want the Buildbot to automatically
build any of the user branches, but it should be willing to build a
user branch when explicitly requested (most likely by the user who
owns that branch).

There are three things that need to be set up to accomodate this
system. The first is a :class:`ChangeSource` that is capable of identifying the
branch which owns any given file. This depends upon a user-supplied
function, in an external program that runs in the SVN commit hook and
connects to the buildmaster's :class:`PBChangeSource` over a TCP
connection. (you can use the ``buildbot sendchange`` utility
for this purpose, but you will still need an external program to
decide what value should be passed to the :option:`--branch=` argument).
For example, a change to a file with the SVN url of
``svn://svn.example.org/MyProject/features/newthing/src/foo.c`` should
be broken down into a :class:`Change` instance with
``branch='features/newthing'`` and ``file='src/foo.c'``.

The second piece is an :class:`AnyBranchScheduler` which will pay
attention to the desired branches. It will not pay attention to the
user branches, so it will not automatically start builds in response
to changes there. The :class:`AnyBranchScheduler` class requires you to
explicitly list all the branches you want it to use, but it would not
be difficult to write a subclass which used
``branch.startswith('features/')`` to remove the need for this
explicit list. Or, if you want to build user branches too, you can use
:class:`AnyBranchScheduler` with ``branches=None`` to indicate that you want
it to pay attention to all branches.

The third piece is an :class:`SVN` checkout step that is configured to
handle the branches correctly, with a ``baseURL`` value that
matches the way the :class:`ChangeSource` splits each file's URL into base,
branch, and file. ::

    from buildbot.changes.pb import PBChangeSource
    from buildbot.scheduler import AnyBranchScheduler
    from buildbot.process import source, factory
    from buildbot.steps import source, shell
    
    c['change_source'] = PBChangeSource()
    s1 = AnyBranchScheduler('main',
                            ['trunk', 'features/newthing', 'features/otherthing'],
                            10*60, ['test-i386', 'test-ppc'])
    c['schedulers'] = [s1]
    
    f = factory.BuildFactory()
    f.addStep(source.SVN(mode='update',
                         baseURL='svn://svn.example.org/MyProject/',
                         defaultBranch='trunk'))
    f.addStep(shell.Compile(command="make all"))
    f.addStep(shell.Test(command="make test"))
    
    c['builders'] = [
      {'name':'test-i386', 'slavename':'bot-i386', 'builddir':'test-i386',
                           'factory':f },
      {'name':'test-ppc', 'slavename':'bot-ppc', 'builddir':'test-ppc',
                          'factory':f },
     ]

In this example, when a change arrives with a ``branch`` attribute
of `trunk`, the resulting build will have an SVN step that
concatenates ``svn://svn.example.org/MyProject/`` (the ``baseURL``) with
``trunk`` (the branch name) to get the correct svn command. If the
``newthing`` branch has a change to :file:`src/foo.c`, then the SVN step
will concatenate ``svn://svn.example.org/MyProject/`` with
``features/newthing`` to get the svnurl for checkout.

For added flexibility, ``baseURL`` may contain a ``%%BRANCH%%``
placeholder, which will be replaced either by the branch in the SourceStamp or

.. _Step-Darcs-Old:

Darcs (Old)
+++++++++++

The :class:`Darcs` build step performs a
`Darcs <http://darcs.net/>`_ checkout or update.

Like :ref:`Step-SVN-Old`, this step can either be configured to always check
out a specific tree, or set up to pull from a particular branch that
gets specified separately for each build. Also like SVN, the
repository URL given to Darcs is created by concatenating a
``baseURL`` with the branch name, and if no particular branch is
requested, it uses a ``defaultBranch``. The only difference in
usage is that each potential Darcs repository URL must point to a
fully-fledged repository, whereas SVN URLs usually point to sub-trees
of the main Subversion repository. In other words, doing an SVN
checkout of ``baseURL`` is legal, but silly, since you'd probably
wind up with a copy of every single branch in the whole repository.
Doing a Darcs checkout of ``baseURL`` is just plain wrong, since
the parent directory of a collection of Darcs repositories is not
itself a valid repository.

The Darcs step takes the following arguments:

``repourl``
    (required unless ``baseURL`` is provided): the URL at which the
    Darcs source repository is available.

``baseURL``
    (required unless ``repourl`` is provided): the base repository URL,
    to which a branch name will be appended. It should probably end in a
    slash.

``defaultBranch``
    (allowed if and only if ``baseURL`` is provided): this specifies
    the name of the branch to use when a Build does not provide one of its
    own. This will be appended to ``baseURL`` to create the string that
    will be passed to the ``darcs get`` command.

.. _Step-Mercurial-Old:

.. index::
   Mercurial (Old)
   Build Steps; Mercurial (Old)
    
Mercurial (Old)
+++++++++++++++

The :class:`Mercurial` build step performs a
`Mercurial <http://selenic.com/mercurial>`_ (aka `hg`) checkout
or update.

Branches are available in two modes: `dirname` like :ref:`Step-Darcs-Old`\, or
`inrepo`, which uses the repository internal branches. Make sure this
setting matches your changehook, if you have that installed.

The Mercurial step takes the following arguments:

``repourl``
    (required unless ``baseURL`` is provided): the URL at which the
    Mercurial source repository is available.

``baseURL``
    (required unless ``repourl`` is provided): the base repository URL,
    to which a branch name will be appended. It should probably end in a
    slash.

``defaultBranch``
    (allowed if and only if ``baseURL`` is provided): this specifies
    the name of the branch to use when a :class:`Build` does not provide one of its
    own. This will be appended to ``baseURL`` to create the string that
    will be passed to the ``hg clone`` command.

``branchType``
    either 'dirname' (default) or 'inrepo' depending on whether
    the branch name should be appended to the ``baseURL``
    or the branch is a mercurial named branch and can be
    found within the ``repourl``.

``clobberOnBranchChange``
    boolean, defaults to ``True``. If set and
    using inrepos branches, clobber the tree
    at each branch change. Otherwise, just
    update to the branch.

.. _Step-Bzr-Old:

.. index::
   Bzr (Old)
   Build Steps; Bzr (Old)

Bzr (Old)
+++++++++

bzr is a descendant of Arch/Baz, and is frequently referred to
as simply `Bazaar`. The repository-vs-workspace model is similar to
Darcs, but it uses a strictly linear sequence of revisions (one
history per branch) like Arch. Branches are put in subdirectories.
This makes it look very much like Mercurial. It takes the following
arguments:

``repourl``
    (required unless ``baseURL`` is provided): the URL at which the
    Bzr source repository is available.

``baseURL``
    (required unless ``repourl`` is provided): the base repository URL,
    to which a branch name will be appended. It should probably end in a
    slash.

``defaultBranch``
    (allowed if and only if ``baseURL`` is provided): this specifies
    the name of the branch to use when a Build does not provide one of its
    own. This will be appended to ``baseURL`` to create the string that
    will be passed to the ``bzr checkout`` command.

``forceSharedRepo``
    (boolean, optional, defaults to ``False``): If set to ``True``, the working directory
    will be made into a bzr shared repository if it is not already. Shared
    repository greatly reduces the amount of history data that needs to be
    downloaded if not using update/copy mode, or if using update/copy mode with
    multiple branches.

P4 (Old)
++++++++

.. @cindex Perforce Update
.. @bsindex buildbot.steps.source.P4
.. TODO @bsindex buildbot.steps.source.P4Sync


The :class:`P4` build step creates a `Perforce <http://www.perforce.com/>`_
client specification and performs an update.

``p4base``
    A view into the Perforce depot without branch name or trailing "...".
    Typically ``//depot/proj/``.

``defaultBranch``
    A branch name to append on build requests if none is specified.
    Typically ``trunk``.

``p4port``
    (optional): the :samp:`{host}:{port}` string describing how to get to the P4 Depot
    (repository), used as the :option:`-p` argument for all p4 commands.
    
``p4user``
    (optional): the Perforce user, used as the :option:`-u` argument to all p4
    commands.

``p4passwd``
    (optional): the Perforce password, used as the :option:`-p` argument to all p4
    commands.

``p4extra_views``
    (optional): a list of ``(depotpath, clientpath)`` tuples containing extra
    views to be mapped into the client specification. Both will have
    "/..." appended automatically. The client name and source directory
    will be prepended to the client path.

``p4client``
    (optional): The name of the client to use. In ``mode='copy'`` and
    ``mode='update'``, it's particularly important that a unique name is used
    for each checkout directory to avoid incorrect synchronization. For
    this reason, Python percent substitution will be performed on this value
    to replace %(slave)s with the slave name and %(builder)s with the
    builder name. The default is `buildbot_%(slave)s_%(build)s`.

``p4line_end``
    (optional): The type of line ending handling P4 should use.  This is
    added directly to the cliet spec's :class:`LineEnd` property.  The default is
    ``local``.

.. _Step-Git-Old:

.. index::
   Git (Old)
   Build Steps; Git (Old)

Git (Old)
+++++++++

.. @cindex Git Checkout
.. @bsindex buildbot.steps.source.Git

The :class:`Git` build step clones or updates a `Git <http://git.or.cz/>`_
repository and checks out the specified branch or revision. Note
that the buildbot supports Git version 1.2.0 and later: earlier
versions (such as the one shipped in Ubuntu 'Dapper') do not support
the ``git init`` command that the buildbot uses.

The :class:`Git` step takes the following arguments:

``repourl``
    (required): the URL of the upstream Git repository.

``branch``
    (optional): this specifies the name of the branch to use when a Build
    does not provide one of its own. If this this parameter is not
    specified, and the :class:`Build` does not provide a branch, the `master`
    branch will be used.

``ignore_ignores``
    (optional): when purging changes, don't use :file:`.gitignore` and
    :file:`.git/info/exclude`.

``submodules``
    (optional): when initializing/updating a Git repository, this decides whether
    or not buildbot should consider git submodules.  Default: ``False``.

``reference``
    (optional): use the specified string as a path to a reference
    repository on the local machine. Git will try to grab objects from
    this path first instead of the main repository, if they exist.

``shallow``
    (optional): instructs git to attempt shallow clones (``--depth 1``).  If the
    user/scheduler asks for a specific revision, this parameter is ignored.

``progress``
    (optional): passes the (@code{--progress}) flag to (@code{git
    fetch}). This solves issues of long fetches being killed due to
    lack of output, but requires Git 1.7.2 or later.

This Source step integrates with :ref:`GerritChangeSource`, and will automatically use
Gerrit's "virtual branch" (``refs/changes/*``) to download the additionnal changes
introduced by a pending changeset.

Gerrit integration can be also triggered using forced build with ``gerrit_change``
property with value in format: ``change_number/patchset_number``.

   Build Steps; BitKeeper (Old)

BitKeeper (Old)
+++++++++++++++

.. @cindex BitKeeper Checkout
.. @bsindex buildbot.steps.source.BK

The :class:`BK` build step performs a `BitKeeper <http://www.bitkeeper.com/>`_
checkout or update.

The BitKeeper step takes the following arguments:

``repourl``
    (required unless ``baseURL`` is provided): the URL at which the
    BitKeeper source repository is available.

``baseURL``
    (required unless ``repourl`` is provided): the base repository URL,
    to which a branch name will be appended. It should probably end in a
    slash.

.. _Step-Repo-Old:

.. index:: Repo init sync

Repo (Old)
++++++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.source.Repo

The :class:`Repo` build step performs a `Repo <http://lwn.net/Articles/304488/>`_
init and sync.

The Repo step takes the following arguments:

``manifest_url``
    (required): the URL at which the Repo's manifests source repository is available.

``manifest_branch``
    (optional, defaults to ``master``): the manifest repository branch
    on which repo will take its manifest. Corresponds to the ``-b``
    argument to the :command:`repo init` command.

``manifest_file``
    (optional, defaults to ``default.xml``): the manifest
    filename. Corresponds to the ``-m`` argument to the :command:`repo
    init` command.

``tarball``
    (optional, defaults to ``None``): the repo tarball used for
    fast bootstrap. If not present the tarball will be created
    automatically after first sync. It is a copy of the ``.repo``
    directory which contains all the git objects. This feature helps
    to minimize network usage on very big projects.

This Source step integrates with :ref:`GerritChangeSource`, and will
automatically use the :command:`repo download` command of repo to
download the additionnal changes introduced by a pending changeset.

Gerrit integration can be also triggered using forced build with following properties:
``repo_d``, ``repo_d[0-9]``, ``repo_download``, ``repo_download[0-9]``
with values in format: ``project/change_number/patchset_number``.
All of these properties will be translated into a :command:`repo download`.
This feature allows integrators to build with several pending interdependent changes,
which at the moment cannot be described properly in Gerrit, and can only be described
by humans.

Monotone (Old)
++++++++++++++

.. @cindex Monotone Checkout
.. @bsindex buildbot.steps.source.Monotone


The :class:`Monotone` build step performs a
`Monotone <http://www.monotone.ca>`_, (aka ``mtn``) checkout
or update.

The Monotone step takes the following arguments:

``repourl``
    the URL at which the Monotone source repository is available.

``branch``
    this specifies the name of the branch to use when a Build does not
    provide one of its own.

``progress``
    this is a boolean that has a pull from the repository use
    ``--ticker=dot`` instead of the default ``--ticker=none``.

.. index::
   ShellCommand
   Build Steps; ShellCommand

.. _Step-ShellCommand:

ShellCommand
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most interesting steps involve exectuing a process of some sort on the
buildslave.  The :class:`ShellCommand` class handles this activity.

Several subclasses of :class:`ShellCommand` are provided as starting points for
common build steps.

Using ShellCommands
+++++++++++++++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.shell.ShellCommand

This is a useful base class for just about everything you might want
to do during a build (except for the initial source checkout). It runs
a single command in a child shell on the buildslave. All stdout/stderr
is recorded into a :class:`LogFile`. The step finishes with a status of ``FAILURE``
if the command's exit code is non-zero, otherwise it has a status of
``SUCCESS``.

The preferred way to specify the command is with a list of argv strings,
since this allows for spaces in filenames and avoids doing any fragile
shell-escaping. You can also specify the command with a single string, in
which case the string is given to :samp:`/bin/sh -c {COMMAND}` for parsing.

On Windows, commands are run via ``cmd.exe /c`` which works well. However,
if you're running a batch file, the error level does not get propagated
correctly unless you add 'call' before your batch file's name:
``cmd=['call', 'myfile.bat', ...]``.

:class:`ShellCommand` arguments:

``command``
    a list of strings (preferred) or single string (discouraged) which
    specifies the command to be run. A list of strings is preferred
    because it can be used directly as an argv array. Using a single
    string (with embedded spaces) requires the buildslave to pass the
    string to :command:`/bin/sh` for interpretation, which raises all sorts of
    difficult questions about how to escape or interpret shell
    metacharacters.

``workdir``
    All ShellCommands are run by default in the ``workdir``, which
    defaults to the :file:`build` subdirectory of the slave builder's
    base directory. The absolute path of the workdir will thus be the
    slave's basedir (set as an option to ``buildslave create-slave``,
    :ref:`Creating-a-buildslave`) plus the builder's basedir (set in the
    builder's ``c['builddir']`` key in :file:`master.cfg`) plus the workdir
    itself (a class-level attribute of the BuildFactory, defaults to
    :file:`build`).

    For example::
    
        f.addStep(ShellCommand(command=["make", "test"],
                               workdir="build/tests"))

``env``
    a dictionary of environment strings which will be added to the child
    command's environment. For example, to run tests with a different i18n
    language setting, you might use ::

        f.addStep(ShellCommand(command=["make", "test"],
                               env={'LANG': 'fr_FR'}))

    These variable settings will override any existing ones in the
    buildslave's environment or the environment specified in the
    :class:`Builder`. The exception is :envvar:`PYTHONPATH`, which is merged
    with (actually prepended to) any existing :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` setting. The
    value is treated as a list of directories to prepend, and a single
    string is treated like a one-item list. For example, to prepend both
    :file:`/usr/local/lib/python2.3` and :file:`/home/buildbot/lib/python`
    to any existing :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` setting, you would do something like the
    following::
    
        f.addStep(ShellCommand(
                      command=["make", "test"],
                      env={'PYTHONPATH': ["/usr/local/lib/python2.3",
                                           "/home/buildbot/lib/python"] }))
    
    Those variables support expansion so that if you just want to prepend
    :file:`/home/buildbot/bin` to the :envvar:`PATH` environment variable, you can do
    it by putting the value ``${PATH}`` at the end of the string like
    in the example below. Variables that doesn't exists on the slave will be
    replaced by ``""``. ::
    
        f.addStep(ShellCommand(
                      command=["make", "test"],
                      env={'PATH': "/home/buildbot/bin:${PATH}"}))

``want_stdout``
    if ``False``, stdout from the child process is discarded rather than being
    sent to the buildmaster for inclusion in the step's :class:`LogFile`.

``want_stderr``
    like ``want_stdout`` but for :file:`stderr`. Note that commands run through
    a PTY do not have separate :file:`stdout`/:file:`stderr` streams: both are merged into
    :file:`stdout`.

``usePTY``
    Should this command be run in a ``pty``?  The default is to observe the
    configuration of the client (:ref:`Buildslave-Options`), but specifying
    ``True`` or ``False`` here will override the
    default. This option is not available on Windows.

    In general, you do not want to use a pseudo-terminal.  This is is
    *only* useful for running commands that require a terminal - for
    example, testing a command-line application that will only accept
    passwords read from a terminal. Using a pseudo-terminal brings
    lots of compatibility problems, and prevents Buildbot from
    distinguishing the standard error (red) and standard output
    (black) streams.

    In previous versions, the advantage of using a pseudo-terminal was
    that ``grandchild`` processes were more likely to be cleaned up if
    the build was interrupted or times out.  This occurred because
    using a pseudo-terminal incidentally puts the command into its own
    process group.

    As of Buildbot-0.8.4, all commands are placed in process groups,
    and thus grandchild processes will be cleaned up properly.

``logfiles``
    Sometimes commands will log interesting data to a local file, rather
    than emitting everything to stdout or stderr. For example, Twisted's
    :command:`trial` command (which runs unit tests) only presents summary
    information to stdout, and puts the rest into a file named
    :file:`_trial_temp/test.log`. It is often useful to watch these files
    as the command runs, rather than using :command:`/bin/cat` to dump
    their contents afterwards.
    
    The ``logfiles=`` argument allows you to collect data from these
    secondary logfiles in near-real-time, as the step is running. It
    accepts a dictionary which maps from a local Log name (which is how
    the log data is presented in the build results) to either a remote filename
    (interpreted relative to the build's working directory), or a dictionary
    of options. Each named file will be polled on a regular basis (every couple
    of seconds) as the build runs, and any new text will be sent over to the
    buildmaster.
    
    If you provide a dictionary of options instead of a string, you must specify
    the ``filename`` key. You can optionally provide a ``follow`` key which
    is a boolean controlling whether a logfile is followed or concatenated in its
    entirety.  Following is appropriate for logfiles to which the build step will
    append, where the pre-existing contents are not interesting.  The default value
    for ``follow`` is ``False``, which gives the same behavior as just
    providing a string filename. ::
    
        f.addStep(ShellCommand(
                      command=["make", "test"],
                      logfiles={"triallog": "_trial_temp/test.log"}))
    
    The above example will add a log named 'triallog' on the master,
    based on :file:`_trial_temp/test.log` on the slave. ::

        f.addStep(ShellCommand(
                      command=["make", "test"],
                      logfiles={"triallog": {"filename": "_trial_temp/test.log",
                           "follow": True,}}))


``lazylogfiles``
    If set to ``True``, logfiles will be tracked lazily, meaning that they will
    only be added when and if something is written to them. This can be used to
    suppress the display of empty or missing log files. The default is ``False``.


``timeout``
    if the command fails to produce any output for this many seconds, it
    is assumed to be locked up and will be killed. This defaults to
    1200 seconds. Pass ``None`` to disable.


``maxTime``
    if the command takes longer than this many seconds, it will be
    killed. This is disabled by default.

``description``
    This will be used to describe the command (on the Waterfall display)
    while the command is still running. It should be a single
    imperfect-tense verb, like `compiling` or `testing`. The preferred
    form is a list of short strings, which allows the HTML 
    displays to create narrower columns by emitting a <br> tag between each
    word. You may also provide a single string.

``descriptionDone``
    This will be used to describe the command once it has finished. A
    simple noun like `compile` or `tests` should be used. Like
    ``description``, this may either be a list of short strings or a
    single string.

    If neither ``description`` nor ``descriptionDone`` are set, the
    actual command arguments will be used to construct the description.
    This may be a bit too wide to fit comfortably on the Waterfall
    display. ::
    
        f.addStep(ShellCommand(command=["make", "test"],
                               description=["testing"],
                               descriptionDone=["tests"]))

``logEnviron``
    If this option is ``True`` (the default), then the step's logfile will describe the
    environment variables on the slave.  In situations where the environment is not
    relevant and is long, it may be easier to set ``logEnviron=False``.

.. _Step-Configure:

.. index::
   Configure
   Build Steps; Configure

Configure
+++++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.shell.Configure

This is intended to handle the :command:`./configure` step from
autoconf-style projects, or the ``perl Makefile.PL`` step from perl
:file:`MakeMaker.pm`-style modules. The default command is :command:`./configure`
but you can change this by providing a ``command=`` parameter.

.. _Step-Compile:

.. index::
   Compile
   Build Steps; Compile

Compile
+++++++

.. @bsindex buildbot.steps.shell.Compile

This is meant to handle compiling or building a project written in C.
The default command is ``make all``. When the compile is finished,
the log file is scanned for GCC warning messages, a summary log is
created with any problems that were seen, and the step is marked as
WARNINGS if any were discovered. Through the :class:`WarningCountingShellCommand`
superclass, the number of warnings is stored in a Build Property named
`warnings-count`, which is accumulated over all :class:`Compile` steps (so if two
warnings are found in one step, and three are found in another step, the
overall build will have a `warnings-count` property of 5). Each step can be
optionally given a maximum number of warnings via the maxWarnCount parameter.
If this limit is exceeded, the step will be marked as a failure.


The default regular expression used to detect a warning is
``'.*warning[: ].*'`` , which is fairly liberal and may cause
false-positives. To use a different regexp, provide a
``warningPattern=`` argument, or use a subclass which sets the
``warningPattern`` attribute::

    f.addStep(Compile(command=["make", "test"],
                      warningPattern="^Warning: "))

The ``warningPattern=`` can also be a pre-compiled python regexp
object: this makes it possible to add flags like ``re.I`` (to use
case-insensitive matching).

Note that the compiled ``warningPattern`` will have its :meth:`match` method
called, which is subtly different from a :meth:`search`. Your regular
expression must match the from the beginning of the line. This means that to
look for the word "warning" in the middle of a line, you will need to
prepend ``'.*'`` to your regular expression.

The ``suppressionFile=`` argument can be specified as the (relative) path
of a file inside the workdir defining warnings to be suppressed from the
warning counting and log file. The file will be uploaded to the master from
the slave before compiling, and any warning matched by a line in the
suppression file will be ignored. This is useful to accept certain warnings
(eg. in some special module of the source tree or in cases where the compiler
is being particularly stupid), yet still be able to easily detect and fix the
introduction of new warnings.

The file must contain one line per pattern of warnings to ignore. Empty lines
and lines beginning with ``#`` are ignored. Other lines must consist of a
regexp matching the file name, followed by a colon (``:``), followed by a
regexp matching the text of the warning. Optionally this may be followed by
another colon and a line number range. For example:

.. code-block:: none

    # Sample warning suppression file
    
    mi_packrec.c : .*result of 32-bit shift implicitly converted to 64 bits.* : 560-600
    DictTabInfo.cpp : .*invalid access to non-static.*
    kernel_types.h : .*only defines private constructors and has no friends.* : 51

If no line number range is specified, the pattern matches the whole file; if
only one number is given it matches only on that line.

The default warningPattern regexp only matches the warning text, so line
numbers and file names are ignored. To enable line number and file name
matching, privide a different regexp and provide a function (callable) as the
argument of ``warningExtractor=``. The function is called with three
arguments: the :class:`BuildStep` object, the line in the log file with the warning,
and the ``SRE_Match`` object of the regexp search for ``warningPattern``. It
should return a tuple ``(filename, linenumber, warning_test)``. For
example::

    f.addStep(Compile(command=["make"],
                      warningPattern="^(.\*?):([0-9]+): [Ww]arning: (.\*)$",
                      warningExtractor=Compile.warnExtractFromRegexpGroups,
                      suppressionFile="support-files/compiler_warnings.supp"))

(``Compile.warnExtractFromRegexpGroups`` is a pre-defined function that
returns the filename, linenumber, and text from groups (1,2,3) of the regexp
match).

In projects with source files in multiple directories, it is possible to get
full path names for file names matched in the suppression file, as long as the
build command outputs the names of directories as they are entered into and
left again. For this, specify regexps for the arguments
``directoryEnterPattern=`` and ``directoryLeavePattern=``. The
``directoryEnterPattern=`` regexp should return the name of the directory
entered into in the first matched group. The defaults, which are suitable for
.. GNU Make, are these::

..     directoryEnterPattern = "make.*: Entering directory [\"`'](.*)['`\"]"
..     directoryLeavePattern = "make.*: Leaving directory"

(TODO: this step needs to be extended to look for GCC error messages
as well, and collect them into a separate logfile, along with the
source code filenames involved).

Visual C++
++++++++++

This step is meant to handle compilation using Microsoft compilers. 
VC++ 6-9, VS2003, VS2005, VS2008, and VCExpress9 are supported. This step will take care
of setting up a clean compilation environment, parse the generated
output in real time and deliver as detailed as possible information
about the compilation executed.

All of the classes are in :mod:`buildbot.steps.vstudio`.  The available classes are:

 * ``VC6``
 * ``VC7``
 * ``VC8``
 * ``VC9``
 * ``VS2003``
 * ``VC2005``
 * ``VC2008``
 * ``VCExpress9``

The available constructor arguments are

``mode``
    The mode default to ``rebuild``, which means that first all the
    remaining object files will be cleaned by the compiler. The alternate
    value is ``build``, where only the updated files will be recompiled.

``projectfile``
    This is a mandatory argument which specifies the project file to be used
    during the compilation.

``config``
    This argument defaults to ``release`` an gives to the compiler the
    configuration to use.

``installdir``
    This is the place where the compiler is installed. The default value is
    compiler specific and is the default place where the compiler is installed.

``useenv``
    This boolean parameter, defaulting to ``False`` instruct the compiler
    to use its own settings or the one defined through the environment
    variables :envvar:`PATH`, :envvar:`INCLUDE`, and :envvar:`LIB`. If any of
    the ``INCLUDE`` or  ``LIB`` parameter is defined, this parameter
    automatically switches to ``True``.

``PATH``
    This is a list of path to be added to the :envvar:`PATH` environment
    variable. The default value is the one defined in the compiler options.

``INCLUDE``
    This is a list of path where the compiler will first look for include
    files. Then comes the default paths defined in the compiler options.

``LIB``
    This is a list of path where the compiler will first look for
    libraries. Then comes the default path defined in the compiler options.

``arch``
    That one is only available with the class VS2005 (VC8). It gives the
    target architecture of the built artifact. It defaults to ``x86``.

``project``
    This gives the specific project to build from within a
    workspace. It defaults to building all projects. This is useful
    for building cmake generate projects.

Here is an example on how to use this step::

    from buildbot.steps.VisualStudio import VS2005

    f.addStep(VS2005(
            projectfile="project.sln", config="release",
            arch="x64", mode="build",
            INCLUDE=[r'D:\WINDDK\Include\wnet'],
            LIB=[r'D:\WINDDK\lib\wnet\amd64']))

.. index::
   Test
   Build Steps; Test

.. _Step-Test:

Test
++++

This is meant to handle unit tests. The default command is :command:`make
test`, and the ``warnOnFailure`` flag is set.

.. _Step-TreeSize:

.. index::
   TreeSize
   Build Steps; TreeSize

TreeSize
++++++++

This is a simple command that uses the :command:`du` tool to measure the size
of the code tree. It puts the size (as a count of 1024-byte blocks,
aka 'KiB' or 'kibibytes') on the step's status text, and sets a build
property named 'tree-size-KiB' with the same value.

.. _Step-PerlModuleTest:

.. index::
   PerlModuleTest
   Build Steps; PerlModuleTest

PerlModuleTest
++++++++++++++

This is a simple command that knows how to run tests of perl modules.
It parses the output to determine the number of tests passed and
failed and total number executed, saving the results for later query.

.. _Step-MTR:    
    
.. index::
   MTR
   Build Steps; MTR

Testing with mysql-test-run
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The :class:`process.mtrlogobserver.MTR` class is a subclass of :class:`Test`
(:ref:`Step-Test`). It is used to run test suites using the mysql-test-run program,
as used in MySQL, Drizzle, MariaDB, and MySQL storage engine plugins.

The shell command to run the test suite is specified in the same way as for
the :class:`Test` class. The :class:`MTR` class will parse the output of running the test suite,
and use the count of tests executed so far to provide more accurate completion
time estimates. Any test failures that occur during the test are summarized on
the Waterfall Display.

Server error logs are added as additional log files, useful to debug test
failures.

Optionally, data about the test run and any test failures can be inserted into
a database for further analysis and report generation. To use this facility,
create an instance of :class:`twisted.enterprise.adbapi.ConnectionPool` with
connections to the database. The necessary tables can be created automatically
by setting ``autoCreateTables`` to ``True``, or manually using the SQL
found in the :file:`mtrlogobserver.py` source file.

One problem with specifying a database is that each reload of the
configuration will get a new instance of ``ConnectionPool`` (even if the
connection parameters are the same). To avoid that Buildbot thinks the builder
configuration has changed because of this, use the
:class:`process.mtrlogobserver.EqConnectionPool` subclass of
:class:`ConnectionPool`, which implements an equiality operation that avoids
this problem.

Example use::

    from buildbot.process.mtrlogobserver import MTR, EqConnectionPool
    myPool = EqConnectionPool("MySQLdb", "host", "buildbot", "password", "db")
    myFactory.addStep(MTR(workdir="mysql-test", dbpool=myPool,
                          command=["perl", "mysql-test-run.pl", "--force"]))

:class:`MTR` arguments:

``textLimit``
    Maximum number of test failures to show on the waterfall page (to not flood
    the page in case of a large number of test failures. Defaults to 5.

``testNameLimit``
    Maximum length of test names to show unabbreviated in the waterfall page, to
    avoid excessive column width. Defaults to 16.

``parallel``
    Value of :option:`--parallel` option used for :file:`mysql-test-run.pl` (number of processes
    used to run the test suite in parallel). Defaults to 4. This is used to
    determine the number of server error log files to download from the
    slave. Specifying a too high value does not hurt (as nonexisting error logs
    will be ignored), however if using :option:`--parallel` value greater than the default
    it needs to be specified, or some server error logs will be missing.

``dbpool``
    An instance of :class:`twisted.enterprise.adbapi.ConnectionPool`, or ``None``.  Defaults to
    ``None``. If specified, results are inserted into the database using the
    :class:`ConnectionPool`.

``autoCreateTables``
    Boolean, defaults to ``False``. If ``True`` (and ``dbpool`` is specified), the
    necessary database tables will be created automatically if they do not exist
    already. Alternatively, the tables can be created manually from the SQL
    statements found in the :file:`mtrlogobserver.py` source file.

``test_type``
    Short string that will be inserted into the database in the row for the test
    run. Defaults to the empty string, but can be specified to identify different
    types of test runs.

``test_info``
    Descriptive string that will be inserted into the database in the row for the test
    run. Defaults to the empty string, but can be specified as a user-readable
    description of this particular test run.

``mtr_subdir``
    The subdirectory in which to look for server error log files. Defaults to
    :file:`mysql-test`, which is usually correct. ``WithProperties`` is supported.

.. index::
   SetProperty
   Build Steps; SetProperty

.. _Step-SetProperty:

SetProperty
+++++++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.shell.SetProperty

This buildstep is similar to :class:`ShellCommand`, except that it captures the
output of the command into a property.  It is usually used like this::

    from buildbot.steps import shell
    f.addStep(shell.SetProperty(command="uname -a", property="uname"))

This runs ``uname -a`` and captures its stdout, stripped of leading
and trailing whitespace, in the property ``uname``.  To avoid stripping,
add ``strip=False``.

The ``property`` argument can be specified as a  ``WithProperties``
object, allowing the property name to be built from other property values.

The more advanced usage allows you to specify a function to extract
properties from the command output.  Here you can use regular
expressions, string interpolation, or whatever you would like. In this
form, :func:`extract_fn` should be passed, and not :class:`Property`. 
The :func:`extract_fn` function is called with three arguments: the exit status of the
command, its standard output as a string, and its standard error as
a string.  It should return a dictionary containing all new properties. ::

    def glob2list(rc, stdout, stderr):
        jpgs = [ l.strip() for l in stdout.split('\n') ]
        return { 'jpgs' : jpgs }
    f.addStep(SetProperty(command="ls -1 *.jpg", extract_fn=glob2list))

Note that any ordering relationship of the contents of stdout and
stderr is lost.  For example, given ::

    f.addStep(SetProperty(
        command="echo output1; echo error >&2; echo output2",
        extract_fn=my_extract))

Then ``my_extract`` will see ``stdout="output1\noutput2\n"``
and ``stderr="error\n"``.


.. seealso:: :ref:`Setting-Properties`

.. _Step-SubunitShellCommand:

.. index::
   SubunitShellCommand
   Build Steps; SubunitShellCommand

SubunitShellCommand
+++++++++++++++++++

.. @bsindex buildbot.steps.subunit.SubunitShellCommand

This buildstep is similar to :class:`ShellCommand`, except that it runs the log content
through a subunit filter to extract test and failure counts. ::

    from buildbot.steps.subunit import SubunitShellCommand
    f.addStep(SubunitShellCommand(command="make test"))

This runs ``make test`` and filters it through subunit. The 'tests' and
'test failed' progress metrics will now accumulate test data from the test run.

If ``failureOnNoTests`` is ``True``, this step will fail if no test is run. By
default ``failureOnNoTests`` is False.

.. _Slave-Filesystem-Steps:

Slave Filesystem Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are some buildsteps for manipulating the slaves filesystem.

.. _RemoveDirectory:

RemoveDirectory
+++++++++++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.slave.RemoveDirectory

This command recursively deletes a directory on the slave. ::

    from buildbot.steps.slave import RemoveDirectory
    f.addStep(RemoveDirectory(dir="build/build"))

.. _Python-BuildSteps:

Python BuildSteps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are some :class:`BuildStep`\s that are specifcally useful for projects
implemented in Python.

.. _Step-BuildEPYDoc:

.. index::
   BuildEPYDoc
   Build Steps; BuildEPYDoc

BuildEPYDoc
+++++++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.python.BuildEPYDoc

`epydoc <http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/>`_ is a tool for generating
API documentation for Python modules from their docstrings. It reads
all the :file:`.py` files from your source tree, processes the docstrings
therein, and creates a large tree of :file:`.html` files (or a single :file:`.pdf`
file).

The :class:`buildbot.steps.python.BuildEPYDoc` step will run
:command:`epydoc` to produce this API documentation, and will count the
errors and warnings from its output.

You must supply the command line to be used. The default is
``make epydocs``, which assumes that your project has a :file:`Makefile`
with an `epydocs` target. You might wish to use something like
:samp:`epydoc -o apiref source/{PKGNAME}` instead. You might also want
to add :option:`--pdf` to generate a PDF file instead of a large tree
of HTML files.

The API docs are generated in-place in the build tree (under the
workdir, in the subdirectory controlled by the :option:`-o` argument). To
make them useful, you will probably have to copy them to somewhere
they can be read. A command like ``rsync -ad apiref/
dev.example.com:~public_html/current-apiref/`` might be useful. You
might instead want to bundle them into a tarball and publish it in the
same place where the generated install tarball is placed. ::

    from buildbot.steps.python import BuildEPYDoc
    # ...
    f.addStep(BuildEPYDoc(command=["epydoc", "-o", "apiref", "source/mypkg"]))

.. _Step-PyFlake:

.. index::
   PyFlakes
   Build Steps; PyFlakes

PyFlakes
++++++++

`PyFlakes <http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodPyflakes>`_ is a tool
to perform basic static analysis of Python code to look for simple
errors, like missing imports and references of undefined names. It is
like a fast and simple form of the C :command:`lint` program. Other tools
(like `pychecker <http://pychecker.sourceforge.net/>`_\)
provide more detailed results but take longer to run.

The :class:`buildbot.steps.python.PyFlakes` step will run pyflakes and
count the various kinds of errors and warnings it detects.

You must supply the command line to be used. The default is
``make pyflakes``, which assumes you have a top-level :file:`Makefile`
with a ``pyflakes`` target. You might want to use something like
``pyflakes .`` or ``pyflakes src``. ::

    from buildbot.steps.python import PyFlakes
    # ...
    f.addStep(PyFlakes(command=["pyflakes", "src"]))

.. _Step-PyLint:
    
.. index::
   PyLint
   Build Steps; PyLint

PyLint
++++++

Similarly, the :class:`buildbot.steps.python.PyLint` step will run :command:`pylint` and
analyze the results.

You must supply the command line to be used. There is no default. ::

    from buildbot.steps.python import PyLint
    # ...
    f.addStep(PyLint(command=["pylint", "src"]))


.. _Step-Trial:

Trial
+++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.python_twisted.Trial

This step runs a unit test suite using :command:`trial`, a unittest-like testing
framework that is a component of Twisted Python. Trial is used to implement
Twisted's own unit tests, and is the unittest-framework of choice for many
projects that use Twisted internally.

Projects that use trial typically have all their test cases in a 'test'
subdirectory of their top-level library directory. For example, for a package
``petmail``, the tests might be in :file:`petmail/test/test_*.py`. More
complicated packages (like Twisted itself) may have multiple test directories,
like :file:`twisted/test/test_*.py` for the core functionality and
:file:`twisted/mail/test/test_*.py` for the email-specific tests.

To run trial tests manually, you run the :command:`trial` executable and tell it
where the test cases are located. The most common way of doing this is with a
module name. For petmail, this might look like :command:`trial petmail.test`, which
would locate all the :file:`test_*.py` files under :file:`petmail/test/`, running
every test case it could find in them.  Unlike the ``unittest.py`` that
comes with Python, it is not necessary to run the :file:`test_foo.py` as a
script; you always let trial do the importing and running. The step's
``tests``` parameter controls which tests trial will run: it can be a string
or a list of strings.

To find the test cases, the Python search path must allow something like
``import petmail.test`` to work. For packages that don't use a separate
top-level :file:`lib` directory, ``PYTHONPATH=.`` will work, and will use the
test cases (and the code they are testing) in-place.
``PYTHONPATH=build/lib`` or ``PYTHONPATH=build/lib.somearch`` are also
useful when you do a ``python setup.py build`` step first. The
``testpath`` attribute of this class controls what :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` is set
to before running :command:`trial`.

Trial has the ability, through the ``--testmodule`` flag, to run only the
set of test cases named by special ``test-case-name`` tags in source files.
We can get the list of changed source files from our parent Build and provide
them to trial, thus running the minimal set of test cases needed to cover the
Changes.  This is useful for quick builds, especially in trees with a lot of
test cases.  The ``testChanges`` parameter controls this feature: if set, it
will override ``tests``.

The trial executable itself is typically just :command:`trial`, and is typically
found in the shell search path.  It can be overridden with the ``trial``
parameter.  This is useful for Twisted's own unittests, which want to use the
copy of bin/trial that comes with the sources.

To influence the version of python being used for the tests, or to add flags to
the command, set the ``python`` parameter. This can be a string (like
``python2.2``) or a list (like ``['python2.3', '-Wall']``).

Trial creates and switches into a directory named :file:`_trial_temp/` before
running the tests, and sends the twisted log (which includes all exceptions) to
a file named :file:`test.log`. This file will be pulled up to the master where
it can be seen as part of the status output. ::

    from buildbot.steps.python_twisted import Trial
    f.addStep(Trial(tests='petmail.test'))

.. _RemovePYCs:

RemovePYCs
++++++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.python_twisted.RemovePYCs

This is a simple built-in step that will remove ``.pyc`` files from the
workdir.  This is useful in builds that update their source (and thus do not
automatically delete ``.pyc`` files) but where some part of the build
process is dynamically searching for Python modules.  Notably, trial has a bad
habit of finding old test modules. ::

    from buildbot.steps.python_twisted import RemovePYCs
    f.addStep(RemovePYCs())

.. _Transferring-Files:
    
.. index::
   FileUpload, FileDownload, DirectoryUpload, File Transfer
   Build Steps; FileUpload
   Build Steps; FileDownload
   Build Steps; DirectoryUpload

Transferring Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.transfer.FileUpload
.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.transfer.FileDownload

Most of the work involved in a build will take place on the
buildslave. But occasionally it is useful to do some work on the
buildmaster side. The most basic way to involve the buildmaster is
simply to move a file from the slave to the master, or vice versa.
There are a pair of :class:`BuildStep`\s named :class:`FileUpload` and
:class:`FileDownload` to provide this functionality. :class:`FileUpload`
moves a file *up to* the master, while :class:`FileDownload` moves
a file *down from* the master.

As an example, let's assume that there is a step which produces an
HTML file within the source tree that contains some sort of generated
project documentation. We want to move this file to the buildmaster,
into a :file:`~/public_html` directory, so it can be visible to
developers. This file will wind up in the slave-side working directory
under the name :file:`docs/reference.html`. We want to put it into the
master-side :file:`~/public_html/ref.html`. ::

    from buildbot.steps.shell import ShellCommand
    from buildbot.steps.transfer import FileUpload
    
    f.addStep(ShellCommand(command=["make", "docs"]))
    f.addStep(FileUpload(slavesrc="docs/reference.html",
                         masterdest="~/public_html/ref.html"))

The ``masterdest=`` argument will be passed to :meth:`os.path.expanduser`,
so things like ``~`` will be expanded properly. Non-absolute paths
will be interpreted relative to the buildmaster's base directory.
Likewise, the ``slavesrc=`` argument will be expanded and
interpreted relative to the builder's working directory.


To move a file from the master to the slave, use the
:class:`FileDownload` command. For example, let's assume that some step
requires a configuration file that, for whatever reason, could not be
recorded in the source code repository or generated on the buildslave
side::

    from buildbot.steps.shell import ShellCommand
    from buildbot.steps.transfer import FileDownload
    
    f.addStep(FileDownload(mastersrc="~/todays_build_config.txt",
                           slavedest="build_config.txt"))
    f.addStep(ShellCommand(command=["make", "config"]))

Like :class:`FileUpload`, the ``mastersrc=`` argument is interpreted
relative to the buildmaster's base directory, and the
``slavedest=`` argument is relative to the builder's working
directory. If the buildslave is running in :file:`~buildslave`, and the
builder's ``builddir`` is something like :file:`tests-i386`, then the
workdir is going to be :file:`~buildslave/tests-i386/build`, and a
``slavedest=`` of :file:`foo/bar.html` will get put in
:file:`~buildslave/tests-i386/build/foo/bar.html`. Both of these commands
will create any missing intervening directories.

Other Parameters
++++++++++++++++

The ``maxsize=`` argument lets you set a maximum size for the file
to be transferred. This may help to avoid surprises: transferring a
100MB coredump when you were expecting to move a 10kB status file
might take an awfully long time. The ``blocksize=`` argument
controls how the file is sent over the network: larger blocksizes are
slightly more efficient but also consume more memory on each end, and
there is a hard-coded limit of about 640kB.

The ``mode=`` argument allows you to control the access permissions
of the target file, traditionally expressed as an octal integer. The
most common value is probably ``0755``, which sets the `x` executable
bit on the file (useful for shell scripts and the like). The default
value for ``mode=`` is None, which means the permission bits will
default to whatever the umask of the writing process is. The default
umask tends to be fairly restrictive, but at least on the buildslave
you can make it less restrictive with a --umask command-line option at
creation time (:ref:`Buildslave-Options`).

The ``keepstamp=`` argument is a boolean that, when ``True``, forces
the modified and accessed time of the destination file to match the
times of the source file.  When ``False`` (the default), the modified and accessed times
of the destination file are set to the current time on the buildmaster.

Transfering Directories
+++++++++++++++++++++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.transfer.DirectoryUpload

To transfer complete directories from the buildslave to the master, there
is a :class:`BuildStep` named :class:`DirectoryUpload`. It works like :class:`FileUpload`,
just for directories. However it does not support the ``maxsize``,
``blocksize`` and ``mode`` arguments. As an example, let's assume an
generated project documentation, which consists of many files (like the output
of :command:`doxygen` or :command:`epydoc`). We want to move the entire documentation to the
buildmaster, into a :file:`~/public_html/docs` directory. On the slave-side
the directory can be found under :file:`docs`::

    from buildbot.steps.shell import ShellCommand
    from buildbot.steps.transfer import DirectoryUpload
    
    f.addStep(ShellCommand(command=["make", "docs"]))
    f.addStep(DirectoryUpload(slavesrc="docs",
                    masterdest="~/public_html/docs"))

The :class:`DirectoryUpload` step will create all necessary directories and
transfers empty directories, too.


The ``maxsize`` and ``blocksize`` parameters are the same as for
:class:`FileUpload`, although note that the size of the transferred data is
implementation-dependent, and probably much larger than you expect due to the
encoding used (currently tar).

The optional ``compress`` argument can be given as ``'gz'`` or
``'bz2'`` to compress the datastream.



.. _Transfering-Strings:

Transfering Strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.transfer.StringDownload
.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.transfer.JSONStringDownload
.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.transfer.JSONPropertiesDownload

Sometimes it is useful to transfer a calculated value from the master to the
slave. Instead of having to create a temporary file and then use FileDownload,
you can use one of the string download steps.

:class:`StringDownload` works just like :class:`FileDownload` except it takes a single argument,
``s``, representing the string to download instead of a ``mastersrc`` argument.

:class:`JSONStringDownload` is similar, except it takes an ``o`` argument, which must be json
serializable, and transfers that as a json-encoded string to the slave.

:class:`JSONPropertiesDownload` transfers a json-encoded string that represents a
dictionary where properties maps to a dictionary of build property ``name`` to
property ``value``; and ``sourcestamp`` represents the build's sourcestamp.

.. _MasterShellCommand:

.. index::
   MasterShellCommand
   Build Steps; MasterShellCommand

Running Commands on the Master
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.master.MasterShellCommand

Occasionally, it is useful to execute some task on the master, for example to
create a directory, deploy a build result, or trigger some other centralized
processing.  This is possible, in a limited fashion, with the
:class:`MasterShellCommand` step.

This step operates similarly to a regular :class:`ShellCommand`, but executes on
the master, instead of the slave.  To be clear, the enclosing :class:`Build`
object must still have a slave object, just as for any other step -- only, in
this step, the slave does not do anything.

In this example, the step renames a tarball based on the day of the week. ::

    from buildbot.steps.transfer import FileUpload
    from buildbot.steps.master import MasterShellCommand
    
    f.addStep(FileUpload(slavesrc="widgetsoft.tar.gz",
                         masterdest="/var/buildoutputs/widgetsoft-new.tar.gz"))
    f.addStep(MasterShellCommand(command="""
        cd /var/buildoutputs;
        mv widgetsoft-new.tar.gz widgetsoft-`date +%a`.tar.gz"""))

.. note:: By default, this step passes a copy of the buildmaster's environment
   variables to the subprocess.  To pass an explicit environment instead, add an
   ``env={..}`` argument.

.. _Setting-Properties:

Setting Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.slave.SetPropertiesFromEnv

In Buildbot-0.8.3 and higher, slaves provide their environment variables to the
master on connect.  These can be copied into Buildbot properties with the
:class:`SetPropertiesFromEnv` step.  Pass a variable or list of variables in the
``variables`` parameter, then simply use the values as properties in a later
step.

Note that on Windows, environment variables are case-insensitive, but Buildbot
property names are case sensitive.  The property will have exactly the variable
name you specify, even if the underlying environment variable is capitalized
differently.  If, for example, you use ``variables=['Tmp']``, the result
will be a property named ``Tmp``, even though the environment variable is
displayed as :envvar:`TMP` in the Windows GUI. ::

    from buildbot.steps.slave import SetPropertiesFromEnv
    from buildbot.steps.shell import Compile

    f.addStep(SetPropertiesFromEnv(variables=["SOME_JAVA_LIB_HOME", "JAVAC"]))
    f.addStep(Compile(commands=[WithProperties("%s","JAVAC"), "-cp", WithProperties("%s", "SOME_JAVA_LIB_HOME")))

Note that this step requires that the Buildslave be at least version 0.8.3.
For previous versions, no environment variables are available (the slave
environment will appear to be empty).

.. seealso::
  
   :ref:`Step-SetProperty`, which runs a command on the slave and sets a
   property based on the result.

   Trigger
   Build Steps; Trigger

.. _Triggering-Schedulers:

Triggering Schedulers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The counterpart to the Triggerable described in section
:ref:`Triggerable-Scheduler` is the :class:`Trigger` :class:`BuildStep`. ::

    from buildbot.steps.trigger import Trigger
    f.addStep(Trigger(schedulerNames=['build-prep'],
                      waitForFinish=True,
                      updateSourceStamp=True,
                      set_properties=@{ 'quick' : False @},
                      copy_properties=[ 'release_code_name' ]))

The ``schedulerNames=`` argument lists the :class:`Triggerable`\s
that should be triggered when this step is executed.  Note that
it is possible, but not advisable, to create a cycle where a build
continually triggers itself, because the schedulers are specified
by name.

If ``waitForFinish`` is ``True``, then the step will not finish until
all of the builds from the triggered schedulers have finished. If this
argument is ``False`` (the default) or not given, then the buildstep
succeeds immediately after triggering the schedulers.

The SourceStamp to use for the triggered build is controlled by the arguments
``updateSourceStamp``, ``alwaysUseLatest``, and ``sourceStamp``.
If ``updateSourceStamp`` is ``True`` (the default), then step updates
the :class:`SourceStamp` given to the :class:`Triggerable`\s to include
``got_revision`` (the revision actually used in this build) as
``revision`` (the revision to use in the triggered builds). This is
useful to ensure that all of the builds use exactly the same
:class:`SourceStamp`, even if other :class:`Change`\s have occurred while the build was
running. If ``updateSourceStamp`` is False (and neither of the other
arguments are specified), then the exact same SourceStamp is used. If
``alwaysUseLatest`` is True, then no SourceStamp is given, corresponding to
using the latest revision of the repository specified in the Source step. This
is useful if the triggered builds use to a different source repository.
:class:`SourceStamp` accepts a dictionary containing the keys ``branch``,
``revision``, ``branch``, ``repository``, ``project``, and
optionally ``patch_level``, ``patch_level`` and ``patch_subdir`` and
creates the corresponding SourceStamp.

Two parameters allow control of the properties that are passed to the triggered
scheduler.  To simply copy properties verbatim, list them in the
``copy_properties`` parameter.  To set properties explicitly, use the more
sophisticated ``set_properties``, which takes a dictionary mapping property
names to values.  You may use :ref:`WithProperties` here to dynamically
construct new property values.

Miscellaneous BuildSteps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A number of steps do not fall into any particular category.

.. _HLint:

HLint
+++++

.. py:class:: buildbot.steps.python_twisted.HLint

The :class:`HLint` step runs Twisted Lore, a lint-like checker over a set of
``.xhtml`` files.  Any deviations from recommended style is flagged and put
in the output log.  

The step looks at the list of changes in the build to determine which files to
check - it does not check all files.  It specifically excludes any ``.xhtml``
files in the top-level ``sandbox/`` directory.

The step takes a single, optional, parameter: ``python``.  This specifies the
Python executable to use to run Lore. ::

    from buildbot.steps.python_twisted import HLint
    f.addStep(HLint())

.. _Writing-New-BuildSteps:

Writing New BuildSteps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While it is a good idea to keep your build process self-contained in
the source code tree, sometimes it is convenient to put more
intelligence into your Buildbot configuration. One way to do this is
to write a custom :class:`BuildStep`. Once written, this Step can be used in
the :file:`master.cfg` file.

The best reason for writing a custom :class:`BuildStep` is to better parse the
results of the command being run. For example, a :class:`BuildStep` that knows
about JUnit could look at the logfiles to determine which tests had
been run, how many passed and how many failed, and then report more
detailed information than a simple ``rc==0`` -based `good/bad`
decision.

.. _Writing-BuildStep-Constructors:

Writing BuildStep Constructors
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

:class:`BuildStep` classes have some extra equipment, because they are their own
factories.  Consider the use of a :class:`BuildStep` in :file:`master.cfg`::

    f.addStep(MyStep(someopt="stuff", anotheropt=1))

This creates a single instance of class :class:`MyStep`.  However, Buildbot needs
a new object each time the step is executed.  this is accomplished by storing
the information required to instantiate a new object in the :attr:`factory`
attribute.  When the time comes to construct a new :class:`Build`, :class:`BuildFactory` consults
this attribute (via :meth:`getStepFactory`) and instantiates a new step object.

When writing a new step class, then, keep in mind are that you cannot do
anything "interesting" in the constructor -- limit yourself to checking and
storing arguments.  To ensure that these arguments are provided to any new
objects, call :meth:`self.addFactoryArguments` with any keyword arguments your
constructor needs.

Keep a ``**kwargs`` argument on the end of your options, and pass that up to
the parent class's constructor.

The whole thing looks like this::

    class Frobnify(LoggingBuildStep):
        def __init__(self,
                frob_what="frobee",
                frob_how_many=None,
                frob_how=None,
                **kwargs):
    
            # check
            if frob_how_many is None:
                raise TypeError("Frobnify argument how_many is required")
    
            # call parent
            LoggingBuildStep.__init__(self, **kwargs)
    
            # set Frobnify attributes
            self.frob_what = frob_what
            self.frob_how_many = how_many
            self.frob_how = frob_how
    
            # and record arguments for later
            self.addFactoryArguments(
                frob_what=frob_what,
                frob_how_many=frob_how_many,
                frob_how=frob_how)
    
    class FastFrobnify(Frobnify):
        def __init__(self,
                speed=5,
                **kwargs)
            Frobnify.__init__(self, **kwargs)
            self.speed = speed
            self.addFactoryArguments(
                speed=speed)

.. _BuildStep-LogFiles:
                
BuildStep LogFiles
++++++++++++++++++

Each BuildStep has a collection of `logfiles`. Each one has a short
name, like `stdio` or `warnings`. Each :class:`LogFile` contains an
arbitrary amount of text, usually the contents of some output file
generated during a build or test step, or a record of everything that
was printed to :file:`stdout`/:file:`stderr` during the execution of some command.

These :class:`LogFile`\s are stored to disk, so they can be retrieved later.

Each can contain multiple `channels`, generally limited to three
basic ones: stdout, stderr, and `headers`. For example, when a
ShellCommand runs, it writes a few lines to the `headers` channel to
indicate the exact argv strings being run, which directory the command
is being executed in, and the contents of the current environment
variables. Then, as the command runs, it adds a lot of :file:`stdout` and
:file:`stderr` messages. When the command finishes, a final `header`
line is added with the exit code of the process.

Status display plugins can format these different channels in
different ways. For example, the web page shows LogFiles as text/html,
with header lines in blue text, stdout in black, and stderr in red. A
different URL is available which provides a text/plain format, in
which stdout and stderr are collapsed together, and header lines are
stripped completely. This latter option makes it easy to save the
results to a file and run :command:`grep` or whatever against the
output.

Each :class:`BuildStep` contains a mapping (implemented in a python dictionary)
from :class:`LogFile` name to the actual :class:`LogFile` objects. Status plugins can
get a list of LogFiles to display, for example, a list of HREF links
that, when clicked, provide the full contents of the :class:`LogFile`.

Using LogFiles in custom BuildSteps
###################################

The most common way for a custom :class:`BuildStep` to use a :class:`LogFile` is to
summarize the results of a :class:`ShellCommand` (after the command has
finished running). For example, a compile step with thousands of lines
of output might want to create a summary of just the warning messages.
If you were doing this from a shell, you would use something like:

.. code-block:: bash

    grep "warning:" output.log >warnings.log

In a custom BuildStep, you could instead create a `warnings` :class:`LogFile`
that contained the same text. To do this, you would add code to your
:meth:`createSummary` method that pulls lines from the main output log
and creates a new :class:`LogFile` with the results::

    def createSummary(self, log):
        warnings = []
        sio = StringIO.StringIO(log.getText())
        for line in sio.readlines():
            if "warning:" in line:
                warnings.append()
        self.addCompleteLog('warnings', "".join(warnings))

This example uses the :meth:`addCompleteLog` method, which creates a
new :class:`LogFile`, puts some text in it, and then `closes` it, meaning
that no further contents will be added. This :class:`LogFile` will appear in
the HTML display under an HREF with the name `warnings`, since that
is the name of the :class:`LogFile`.

You can also use :meth:`addHTMLLog` to create a complete (closed)
:class:`LogFile` that contains HTML instead of plain text. The normal :class:`LogFile`
will be HTML-escaped if presented through a web page, but the HTML
:class:`LogFile` will not. At the moment this is only used to present a pretty
HTML representation of an otherwise ugly exception traceback when
something goes badly wrong during the :class:`BuildStep`.

In contrast, you might want to create a new :class:`LogFile` at the beginning
of the step, and add text to it as the command runs. You can create
the :class:`LogFile` and attach it to the build by calling :meth:`addLog`, which
returns the :class:`LogFile` object. You then add text to this :class:`LogFile` by
calling methods like :meth:`addStdout` and :meth:`addHeader`. When you
are done, you must call the :meth:`finish` method so the :class:`LogFile` can be
closed. It may be useful to create and populate a :class:`LogFile` like this
from a :class:`LogObserver` method :ref:`Adding-LogObservers`.

The ``logfiles=`` argument to :class:`ShellCommand` (see
:ref:`Step-ShellCommand`) creates new :class:`LogFile`\s and fills them in realtime
by asking the buildslave to watch a actual file on disk. The
buildslave will look for additions in the target file and report them
back to the :class:`BuildStep`. These additions will be added to the :class:`LogFile` by
calling :meth:`addStdout`. These secondary LogFiles can be used as the
source of a LogObserver just like the normal :file:`stdio` :class:`LogFile`.

.. _Reading-Logfiles:

Reading Logfiles
++++++++++++++++

Once a :class:`LogFile` has been added to a :class:`BuildStep` with :meth:`addLog()`,
:meth:`addCompleteLog()`, :meth:`addHTMLLog()`, or ``logfiles=}``,
your :class:`BuildStep` can retrieve it by using :meth:`getLog()`::

    class MyBuildStep(ShellCommand):
        logfiles = @{ "nodelog": "_test/node.log" @}
    
        def evaluateCommand(self, cmd):
            nodelog = self.getLog("nodelog")
            if "STARTED" in nodelog.getText():
                return SUCCESS
            else:
                return FAILURE

For a complete list of the methods you can call on a :class:`LogFile`, please
see the docstrings on the :class:`IStatusLog` class in
:file:`buildbot/interfaces.py`.

.. _Adding-LogObservers:

Adding LogObservers
+++++++++++++++++++

.. @cindex LogObserver
.. @cindex LogLineObserver

Most shell commands emit messages to stdout or stderr as they operate,
especially if you ask them nicely with a :option:`--verbose` flag of some
sort. They may also write text to a log file while they run. Your
:class:`BuildStep` can watch this output as it arrives, to keep track of how
much progress the command has made. You can get a better measure of
progress by counting the number of source files compiled or test cases
run than by merely tracking the number of bytes that have been written
to stdout. This improves the accuracy and the smoothness of the ETA
display.

To accomplish this, you will need to attach a :class:`LogObserver` to
one of the log channels, most commonly to the :file:`stdio` channel but
perhaps to another one which tracks a log file. This observer is given
all text as it is emitted from the command, and has the opportunity to
parse that output incrementally. Once the observer has decided that
some event has occurred (like a source file being compiled), it can
use the :meth:`setProgress` method to tell the :class:`BuildStep` about the
progress that this event represents.

There are a number of pre-built :class:`LogObserver` classes that you
can choose from (defined in :mod:`buildbot.process.buildstep`, and of
course you can subclass them to add further customization. The
:class:`LogLineObserver` class handles the grunt work of buffering and
scanning for end-of-line delimiters, allowing your parser to operate
on complete :file:`stdout`/:file:`stderr` lines. (Lines longer than a set maximum
length are dropped; the maximum defaults to 16384 bytes, but you can
change it by calling :meth:`setMaxLineLength()` on your
:class:`LogLineObserver` instance.  Use ``sys.maxint`` for effective
infinity.)

For example, let's take a look at the :class:`TrialTestCaseCounter`,
which is used by the :ref:`Step-Trial` step to count test cases as they are run.
As Trial executes, it emits lines like the following:

.. code-block:: none

    buildbot.test.test_config.ConfigTest.testDebugPassword ... [OK]
    buildbot.test.test_config.ConfigTest.testEmpty ... [OK]
    buildbot.test.test_config.ConfigTest.testIRC ... [FAIL]
    buildbot.test.test_config.ConfigTest.testLocks ... [OK]

When the tests are finished, trial emits a long line of `======` and
then some lines which summarize the tests that failed. We want to
avoid parsing these trailing lines, because their format is less
well-defined than the `[OK]` lines.

The parser class looks like this::

    from buildbot.process.buildstep import LogLineObserver
    
    class TrialTestCaseCounter(LogLineObserver):
        _line_re = re.compile(r'^([\w\.]+) \.\.\. \[([^\]]+)\]$')
        numTests = 0
        finished = False
    
        def outLineReceived(self, line):
            if self.finished:
                return
            if line.startswith("=" * 40):
                self.finished = True
                return
    
            m = self._line_re.search(line.strip())
            if m:
                testname, result = m.groups()
                self.numTests += 1
                self.step.setProgress('tests', self.numTests)

This parser only pays attention to stdout, since that's where trial
writes the progress lines. It has a mode flag named ``finished`` to
ignore everything after the ``====`` marker, and a scary-looking
regular expression to match each line while hopefully ignoring other
messages that might get displayed as the test runs.

Each time it identifies a test has been completed, it increments its
counter and delivers the new progress value to the step with
@code{self.step.setProgress}. This class is specifically measuring
progress along the `tests` metric, in units of test cases (as
opposed to other kinds of progress like the `output` metric, which
measures in units of bytes). The Progress-tracking code uses each
progress metric separately to come up with an overall completion
percentage and an ETA value.

To connect this parser into the :class:`Trial` :class:`BuildStep`,
``Trial.__init__`` ends with the following clause::

    # this counter will feed Progress along the 'test cases' metric
    counter = TrialTestCaseCounter()
    self.addLogObserver('stdio', counter)
    self.progressMetrics += ('tests',)

This creates a :class:`TrialTestCaseCounter` and tells the step that the
counter wants to watch the :file:`stdio` log. The observer is
automatically given a reference to the step in its :attr:`step`
attribute.

A Somewhat Whimsical Example
############################

Let's say that we've got some snazzy new unit-test framework called
Framboozle. It's the hottest thing since sliced bread. It slices, it
dices, it runs unit tests like there's no tomorrow. Plus if your unit
tests fail, you can use its name for a Web 2.1 startup company, make
millions of dollars, and hire engineers to fix the bugs for you, while
you spend your afternoons lazily hang-gliding along a scenic pacific
beach, blissfully unconcerned about the state of your
tests. [#]_

To run a Framboozle-enabled test suite, you just run the 'framboozler'
command from the top of your source code tree. The 'framboozler'
command emits a bunch of stuff to stdout, but the most interesting bit
is that it emits the line "FNURRRGH!" every time it finishes running a
test case [#]_. You'd like to have a test-case counting LogObserver that
watches for these lines and counts them, because counting them will
help the buildbot more accurately calculate how long the build will
take, and this will let you know exactly how long you can sneak out of
the office for your hang-gliding lessons without anyone noticing that
you're gone.

This will involve writing a new :class:`BuildStep` (probably named
"Framboozle") which inherits from :class:`ShellCommand`. The :class:`BuildStep` class
definition itself will look something like this::

    # START
    from buildbot.steps.shell import ShellCommand
    from buildbot.process.buildstep import LogLineObserver
    
    class FNURRRGHCounter(LogLineObserver):
        numTests = 0
        def outLineReceived(self, line):
            if "FNURRRGH!" in line:
                self.numTests += 1
                self.step.setProgress('tests', self.numTests)
    
    class Framboozle(ShellCommand):
        command = ["framboozler"]
    
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            ShellCommand.__init__(self, **kwargs)   # always upcall!
            counter = FNURRRGHCounter())
            self.addLogObserver('stdio', counter)
            self.progressMetrics += ('tests',)
    # FINISH

So that's the code that we want to wind up using. How do we actually
deploy it?

You have a couple of different options.

Option 1: The simplest technique is to simply put this text
(everything from START to FINISH) in your :FILE:`master.cfg` file, somewhere
before the :class:`BuildFactory` definition where you actually use it in a
clause like::

    f = BuildFactory()
    f.addStep(SVN(svnurl="stuff"))
    f.addStep(Framboozle())

Remember that :file:`master.cfg` is secretly just a python program with one
job: populating the :file:`BuildmasterConfig` dictionary. And python programs
are allowed to define as many classes as they like. So you can define
classes and use them in the same file, just as long as the class is
defined before some other code tries to use it.

This is easy, and it keeps the point of definition very close to the
point of use, and whoever replaces you after that unfortunate
hang-gliding accident will appreciate being able to easily figure out
what the heck this stupid "Framboozle" step is doing anyways. The
downside is that every time you reload the config file, the Framboozle
class will get redefined, which means that the buildmaster will think
that you've reconfigured all the Builders that use it, even though
nothing changed. Bleh.

Option 2: Instead, we can put this code in a separate file, and import
it into the master.cfg file just like we would the normal buildsteps
like :class:`ShellCommand` and :class:`SVN`.

Create a directory named ~/lib/python, put everything from START to
FINISH in :file:`~/lib/python/framboozle.py`, and run your buildmaster using:

.. code-block:: bash

    PYTHONPATH=~/lib/python buildbot start MASTERDIR

or use the :file:`Makefile.buildbot` to control the way
``buildbot start`` works. Or add something like this to
something like your :file:`~/.bashrc` or :file:`~/.bash_profile` or :file:`~/.cshrc`:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PYTHONPATH=~/lib/python

Once we've done this, our :file:`master.cfg` can look like::

    from framboozle import Framboozle
    f = BuildFactory()
    f.addStep(SVN(svnurl="stuff"))
    f.addStep(Framboozle())

or::

    import framboozle
    f = BuildFactory()
    f.addStep(SVN(svnurl="stuff"))
    f.addStep(framboozle.Framboozle())

(check out the python docs for details about how "import" and "from A
import B" work).

What we've done here is to tell python that every time it handles an
"import" statement for some named module, it should look in our
:file:`~/lib/python/` for that module before it looks anywhere else. After our
directories, it will try in a bunch of standard directories too
(including the one where buildbot is installed). By setting the
:envvar:`PYTHONPATH` environment variable, you can add directories to the front
of this search list.

Python knows that once it "import"s a file, it doesn't need to
re-import it again. This means that reconfiguring the buildmaster
(with ``buildbot reconfig``, for example) won't make it think the
Framboozle class has changed every time, so the Builders that use it
will not be spuriously restarted. On the other hand, you either have
to start your buildmaster in a slightly weird way, or you have to
modify your environment to set the :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` variable.


Option 3: Install this code into a standard python library directory

Find out what your python's standard include path is by asking it:

.. code-block:: none

    80:warner@@luther% python
    Python 2.4.4c0 (#2, Oct  2 2006, 00:57:46)
    [GCC 4.1.2 20060928 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-15)] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> import sys
    >>> import pprint
    >>> pprint.pprint(sys.path)
    ['',
     '/usr/lib/python24.zip',
     '/usr/lib/python2.4',
     '/usr/lib/python2.4/plat-linux2',
     '/usr/lib/python2.4/lib-tk',
     '/usr/lib/python2.4/lib-dynload',
     '/usr/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages',
     '/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages',
     '/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/Numeric',
     '/var/lib/python-support/python2.4',
     '/usr/lib/site-python']

In this case, putting the code into
/usr/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages/framboozle.py would work just
fine. We can use the same :file:`master.cfg` ``import framboozle`` statement as
in Option 2. By putting it in a standard include directory (instead of
the decidedly non-standard :file:`~/lib/python`), we don't even have to set
:envvar:`PYTHONPATH` to anything special. The downside is that you probably have
to be root to write to one of those standard include directories.


Option 4: Submit the code for inclusion in the Buildbot distribution

Make a fork of buildbot on http://github.com/djmitche/buildbot or post a patch
in a bug at http://buildbot.net.  In either case, post a note about your patch
to the mailing list, so others can provide feedback and, eventually, commit it.

    from buildbot.steps import framboozle
    f = BuildFactory()
    f.addStep(SVN(svnurl="stuff"))
    f.addStep(framboozle.Framboozle())

And then you don't even have to install framboozle.py anywhere on your
system, since it will ship with Buildbot. You don't have to be root,
you don't have to set :envvar:  `PYTHONPATH`. But you do have to make a good case
for Framboozle being worth going into the main distribution, you'll
probably have to provide docs and some unit test cases, you'll need to
figure out what kind of beer the author likes, and then you'll have to
wait until the next release. But in some environments, all this is
easier than getting root on your buildmaster box, so the tradeoffs may
actually be worth it.

Putting the code in master.cfg (1) makes it available to that
buildmaster instance. Putting it in a file in a personal library
directory (2) makes it available for any buildmasters you might be
running. Putting it in a file in a system-wide shared library
directory (3) makes it available for any buildmasters that anyone on
that system might be running. Getting it into the buildbot's upstream
repository (4) makes it available for any buildmasters that anyone in
the world might be running. It's all a matter of how widely you want
to deploy that new class.

.. _BuildStep-URLs:

.. index:: links, BuildStep URLs, addURL

BuildStep URLs
++++++++++++++


Each BuildStep has a collection of `links`. Like its collection of
LogFiles, each link has a name and a target URL. The web status page
creates HREFs for each link in the same box as it does for LogFiles,
except that the target of the link is the external URL instead of an
internal link to a page that shows the contents of the LogFile.

These external links can be used to point at build information hosted
on other servers. For example, the test process might produce an
intricate description of which tests passed and failed, or some sort
of code coverage data in HTML form, or a PNG or GIF image with a graph
of memory usage over time. The external link can provide an easy way
for users to navigate from the buildbot's status page to these
external web sites or file servers. Note that the step itself is
responsible for insuring that there will be a document available at
the given URL (perhaps by using :command:`scp` to copy the HTML output
to a :file:`~/public_html/` directory on a remote web server). Calling
:meth:`addURL` does not magically populate a web server.

To set one of these links, the :class:`BuildStep` should call the :meth:`addURL`
method with the name of the link and the target URL. Multiple URLs can
be set.

In this example, we assume that the ``make test`` command causes
a collection of HTML files to be created and put somewhere on the
coverage.example.org web server, in a filename that incorporates the
build number. ::

    class TestWithCodeCoverage(BuildStep):
        command = ["make", "test",
                   WithProperties("buildnum=%s", "buildnumber")]
    
        def createSummary(self, log):
            buildnumber = self.getProperty("buildnumber")
            url = "http://coverage.example.org/builds/%s.html" % buildnumber
            self.addURL("coverage", url)

You might also want to extract the URL from some special message
output by the build process itself::

    class TestWithCodeCoverage(BuildStep):
        command = ["make", "test",
                   WithProperties("buildnum=%s", "buildnumber")]
    
        def createSummary(self, log):
            output = StringIO(log.getText())
            for line in output.readlines():
                if line.startswith("coverage-url:"):
                    url = line[len("coverage-url:"):].strip()
                    self.addURL("coverage", url)
                    return

Note that a build process which emits both :file:`stdout` and :file:`stderr` might
cause this line to be split or interleaved between other lines. It
might be necessary to restrict the :meth:`getText()` call to only stdout with
something like this::

    output = StringIO("".join([c[1]
                               for c in log.getChunks()
                               if c[0] == LOG_CHANNEL_STDOUT]))

Of course if the build is run under a PTY, then stdout and stderr will
be merged before the buildbot ever sees them, so such interleaving
will be unavoidable.

.. [#] Build properties are serialized along with the
    build results, so they must be serializable. For this reason, the
    value of any build property should be simple inert data: strings,
    numbers, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. They should not contain
    class instances.
