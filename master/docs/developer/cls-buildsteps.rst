BuildSteps
==========

.. py:module:: buildbot.process.buildstep

There are a few parent classes that are used as base classes for real buildsteps.
This section describes the base classes.
The "leaf" classes are described in :doc:`../manual/cfg-buildsteps`.

See :ref:`Writing-New-BuildSteps` for a guide to implementing new steps.

BuildStep
---------

.. py:class:: BuildStep(name, description, descriptionDone, descriptionSuffix, locks, haltOnFailure, flunkOnWarnings, flunkOnFailure, warnOnWarnings, warnOnFailure, alwaysRun, progressMetrics, useProgress, doStepIf, hideStepIf)

    All constructor arguments must be given as keyword arguments.
    Each constructor parameter is copied to the corresponding attribute.

    .. py:attribute:: name

        The name of the step.
        Note that this value may change when the step is started, if the existing name was not unique.

    .. py:attribute:: stepid

        The ID of this step in the database.
        This attribute is not set until the step starts.

    .. py:attribute:: description

        The description of the step.

    .. py:attribute:: descriptionDone

        The description of the step after it has finished.

    .. py:attribute:: descriptionSuffix

        Any extra information to append to the description.

    .. py:attribute:: locks

        List of locks for this step; see :ref:`Interlocks`.

    .. py:attribute:: progressMetrics

        List of names of metrics that should be used to track the progress of this build, and build ETA's for users.
        This is generally set in the

    .. py:attribute:: useProgress

        If true (the default), then ETAs will be calculated for this step using progress metrics.
        If the step is known to have unpredictable timing (e.g., an incremental build), then this should be set to false.

    .. py:attribute:: doStepIf

        A callable or bool to determine whether this step should be executed.
        See :ref:`Buildstep-Common-Parameters` for details.

    .. py:attribute:: hideStepIf

        A callable or bool to determine whether this step should be shown in the waterfall and build details pages.
        See :ref:`Buildstep-Common-Parameters` for details.

    The following attributes affect the behavior of the containing build:

    .. py:attribute:: haltOnFailure

        If true, the build will halt on a failure of this step, and not execute subsequent tests (except those with ``alwaysRun``).

    .. py:attribute:: flunkOnWarnings

        If true, the build will be marked as a failure if this step ends with warnings.

    .. py:attribute:: flunkOnFailure

        If true, the build will be marked as a failure if this step fails.

    .. py:attribute:: warnOnWarnings

        If true, the build will be marked as warnings, or worse, if this step ends with warnings.

    .. py:attribute:: warnOnFailure

        If true, the build will be marked as warnings, or worse, if this step fails.

    .. py:attribute:: alwaysRun

        If true, the step will run even if a previous step halts the build with ``haltOnFailure``.

    .. py:attribute:: logEncoding

        The log encoding to use for logs produced in this step, or None to ues the global default.
        See :ref:`Log-Encodings`.

    .. py:attribute:: rendered

        At the begining of the step, the renderable attributes are rendered against the properties.
        There is a slight delay however when those are not yet rendered, which lead to weird and difficult to reproduce bugs.
        To address this problem, a ``rendered`` attribute is available for methods that could be called early in the buildstep creation.

    .. py:attribute:: results

        This is the result (a code from :py:mod:`buildbot.process.results`) of the step.
        This attribute only exists after the step is finished, and should only be used in :py:meth:`getResultSummary`.

    A few important pieces of information are not available when a step is constructed, and are added later.
    These are set by the following methods; the order in which these methods are called is not defined.

    .. py:method:: setBuild(build)

        :param build: the :class:`~buildbot.process.build.Build` instance controlling this step.

        This method is called during setup to set the build instance controlling this slave.
        Subclasses can override this to get access to the build object as soon as it is available.
        The default implementation sets the :attr:`build` attribute.

    .. py:attribute:: build

        The build object controlling this step.

    .. py:method:: setBuildSlave(build)

        :param build: the :class:`~buildbot.buildslave.BuildSlave` instance on which this step will run.

        Similarly, this method is called with the build slave that will run this step.
        The default implementation sets the :attr:`buildslave` attribute.

    .. py:attribute:: buildslave

        The build slave that will run this step.

    .. py:attribute:: workdir

        Implemented as a property.
        Workdir where actions of the step are happening.
        The workdir is by order of priority

        * workdir of the step, if defined via constructor argument

        * workdir of the BuildFactory (itself defaults to 'build').

            BuildFactory workdir can be a function of sourcestamp. See :ref:`Factory-Workdir-Functions`

    .. py:method:: setDefaultWorkdir(workdir)

        :param workdir: the default workdir, from the build

        .. note::

           This method is deprecated and should not be used anymore, as workdir is calculated automatically via a property

    .. py:method:: setupProgress()

        This method is called during build setup to give the step a chance to set up progress tracking.
        It is only called if the build has :attr:`useProgress` set.
        There is rarely any reason to override this method.

    Execution of the step itself is governed by the following methods and attributes.

    .. py:method:: startStep(remote)

        :param remote: a remote reference to the slave-side
            :class:`~buildslave.bot.SlaveBuilder` instance
        :returns: Deferred

        Begin the step.
        This is the build's interface to step execution.
        Subclasses should override :meth:`run` to implement custom behaviors.

    .. py:method:: run()

        :returns: result via Deferred

        Execute the step.
        When this method returns (or when the Deferred it returns fires), the step is complete.
        The method's return value must be an integer, giving the result of the step -- a constant from :mod:`buildbot.process.results`.
        If the method raises an exception or its Deferred fires with failure, then the step will be completed with an EXCEPTION result.
        Any other output from the step (logfiles, status strings, URLs, etc.) is the responsibility of the ``run`` method.

        Subclasses should override this method.
        Do *not* call :py:meth:`finished` or :py:meth:`failed` from this method.

    .. py:method:: start()

        :returns: ``None`` or :data:`~buildbot.process.results.SKIPPED`,
            optionally via a Deferred.

        Begin the step.
        BuildSteps written before Buildbot-0.9.0 often override this method instead of :py:meth:`run`, but this approach is deprecated.

        When the step is done, it should call :py:meth:`finished`, with a result -- a constant from :mod:`buildbot.process.results`.
        The result will be handed off to the :py:class:`~buildbot.process.build.Build`.

        If the step encounters an exception, it should call :meth:`failed` with a Failure object.

        If the step decides it does not need to be run, :meth:`start` can return the constant :data:`~buildbot.process.results.SKIPPED`.
        In this case, it is not necessary to call :meth:`finished` directly.

    .. py:method:: finished(results)

        :param results: a constant from :mod:`~buildbot.process.results`

        A call to this method indicates that the step is finished and the build should analyze the results and perhaps proceed to the next step.
        The step should not perform any additional processing after calling this method.
        This method must only be called from the (deprecated) :py:meth:`start` method.

    .. py:method:: failed(failure)

        :param failure: a :class:`~twisted.python.failure.Failure` instance

        Similar to :meth:`finished`, this method indicates that the step is finished, but handles exceptions with appropriate logging and diagnostics.

        This method handles :exc:`BuildStepFailed` specially, by calling ``finished(FAILURE)``.
        This provides subclasses with a shortcut to stop execution of a step by raising this failure in a context where :meth:`failed` will catch it.
        This method must only be called from the (deprecated) :py:meth:`start` method.

    .. py:method:: interrupt(reason)

        :param reason: why the build was interrupted
        :type reason: string or :class:`~twisted.python.failure.Failure`

        This method is used from various control interfaces to stop a running step.
        The step should be brought to a halt as quickly as possible, by cancelling a remote command, killing a local process, etc.
        The step must still finish with either :meth:`finished` or :meth:`failed`.

        The ``reason`` parameter can be a string or, when a slave is lost during step processing, a :exc:`~twisted.internet.error.ConnectionLost` failure.

        The parent method handles any pending lock operations, and should be called by implementations in subclasses.

    .. py:attribute:: stopped

        If false, then the step is running.
        If true, the step is not running, or has been interrupted.

    A step can indicate its up-to-the-moment status using a short summary string.
    These methods allow step subclasses to produce such summaries.

    .. py:method:: updateSummary()

        Update the summary, calling :py:meth:`getCurrentSummary` or :py:meth:`getResultSummary` as appropriate.
        New-style build steps should call this method any time the summary may have changed.
        This method is debounced, so even calling it for every log line is acceptable.

    .. py:method:: getCurrentSummary()

        :returns: dictionary, optionally via Deferred

        Returns a dictionary containing status information for a running step.
        The dictionary can have a ``step`` key with a unicode value giving a summary for display with the step.
        This method is only called while the step is running.

        New-style build steps should override this method to provide a more interesting summary than the default ``u"running"``.

    .. py:method:: getResultSummary()

        :returns: dictionary, optionally via Deferred

        Returns a dictionary containing status information for a completed step.
        The dictionary can have keys ``step`` and ``build``, each with unicode values.
        The ``step`` key gives a summary for display with the step, while the ``build`` key gives a summary for display with the entire build.
        The latter should be used sparingly, and include only information that the user would find relevant for the entire build, such as a number of test failures.
        Either or both keys can be omitted.

        This method is only called while the step is finished.
        The step's result is available in ``self.results`` at that time.

        New-style build steps should override this method to provide a more interesting summary than the default, or to provide any build summary information.

    .. py:method:: describe(done=False)

        :param done: If true, the step is finished.
        :returns: list of strings

        Describe the step succinctly.
        The return value should be a sequence of short strings suitable for display in a horizontally constrained space.

        .. note::

            Be careful not to assume that the step has been started in this method.
            In relatively rare circumstances, steps are described before they have started.
            Ideally, unit tests should be used to ensure that this method is resilient.

        .. note::

            This method is not called for new-style steps.
            Instead, override :py:meth:`getCurrentSummary` and :py:meth:`getResultSummary`.

    Build steps have statistics, a simple key/value store of data which can later be aggregated over all steps in a build.
    Note that statistics are not preserved after a build is complete.

    .. py:method:: hasStatistic(stat)

        :param string stat: name of the statistic
        :returns: True if the statistic exists on this step

    .. py:method:: getStatistic(stat, default=None)

        :param string stat: name of the statistic
        :param default: default value if the statistic does not exist
        :returns: value of the statistic, or the default value

    .. py:method:: getStatistics()

        :returns: a dictionary of all statistics for this step

    .. py:method:: setStatistic(stat, value)

        :param string stat: name of the statistic
        :param value: value to assign to the statistic
        :returns: value of the statistic

    Build steps support progress metrics - values that increase roughly linearly during the execution of the step, and can thus be used to calculate an expected completion time for a running step.
    A metric may be a count of lines logged, tests executed, or files compiled.
    The build mechanics will take care of translating this progress information into an ETA for the user.

    .. py:method:: setProgress(metric, value)

        :param metric: the metric to update
        :type metric: string
        :param value: the new value for the metric
        :type value: integer

        Update a progress metric.
        This should be called by subclasses that can provide useful progress-tracking information.

        The specified metric name must be included in :attr:`progressMetrics`.

    The following methods are provided as utilities to subclasses.
    These methods should only be invoked after the step is started.

    .. py:method:: slaveVersion(command, oldversion=None)

        :param command: command to examine
        :type command: string
        :param oldversion: return value if the slave does not specify a version
        :returns: string

        Fetch the version of the named command, as specified on the slave.
        In practice, all commands on a slave have the same version, but passing ``command`` is still useful to ensure that the command is implemented on the slave.
        If the command is not implemented on the slave, :meth:`slaveVersion` will return ``None``.

        Versions take the form ``x.y`` where ``x`` and ``y`` are integers, and are compared as expected for version numbers.

        Buildbot versions older than 0.5.0 did not support version queries; in this case, :meth:`slaveVersion` will return ``oldVersion``.
        Since such ancient versions of Buildbot are no longer in use, this functionality is largely vestigial.

    .. py:method:: slaveVersionIsOlderThan(command, minversion)

        :param command: command to examine
        :type command: string
        :param minversion: minimum version
        :returns: boolean

        This method returns true if ``command`` is not implemented on the slave, or if it is older than ``minversion``.

    .. py:method:: slaveVersionHasCommand(command)

        :param command: command to examine
        :type command: string

        This method raise BuildSlaveTooOldError if ``command`` is not implemented on the slave

    .. py:method:: getSlaveName()

        :returns: string

        Get the name of the buildslave assigned to this step.

    Most steps exist to run commands.
    While the details of exactly how those commands are constructed are left to subclasses, the execution of those commands comes down to this method:

    .. py:method:: runCommand(command)

        :param command: :py:class:`~buildbot.process.remotecommand.RemoteCommand` instance
        :returns: Deferred

        This method connects the given command to the step's buildslave and runs it, returning the Deferred from :meth:`~buildbot.process.remotecommand.RemoteCommand.run`.

    The :class:`BuildStep` class provides methods to add log data to the step.
    Subclasses provide a great deal of user-configurable functionality on top of these methods.
    These methods can be called while the step is running, but not before.

    .. py:method:: addLog(name, type="s", logEncoding=None)

        :param name: log name
        :param type: log type; see :bb:rtype:`logchunk`
        :param logEncoding: the log encoding, or None to use the step or global default (see :ref:`Log-Encodings`)
        :returns: :class:`~buildbot.process.log.Log` instance via Deferred

        Add a new logfile with the given name to the step, and return the log file instance.

    .. py:method:: getLog(name)

        :param name: log name
        :raises KeyError: if there is no such log
        :returns: :class:`~buildbot.process.log.Log` instance
        :raises KeyError: if no such log is defined

        Return an existing logfile, previously added with :py:meth:`addLog`.
        Note that this return value is synchronous, and only available after :py:meth:`addLog`'s deferred has fired.

    .. py:method:: addCompleteLog(name, text)

        :param name: log name
        :param text: content of the logfile
        :returns: Deferred

        This method adds a new log and sets ``text`` as its content.
        This is often useful to add a short logfile describing activities performed on the master.
        The logfile is immediately closed, and no further data can be added.

        If the logfile's content is a bytestring, it is decoded with the step's log encoding or the global default log encoding.
        To add a logfile with a different character encoding, perform the decode operation directly and pass the resulting unicode string to this method.

    .. py:method:: addHTMLLog(name, html)

        :param name: log name
        :param html: content of the logfile
        :returns: Deferred

        Similar to :meth:`addCompleteLog`, this adds a logfile containing pre-formatted HTML, allowing more expressiveness than the text format supported by :meth:`addCompleteLog`.

    .. py:method:: addLogObserver(logname, observer)

        :param logname: log name
        :param observer: log observer instance

        Add a log observer for the named log.
        The named log need not have been added already: the observer will be connected when the log is added.

        See :ref:`Adding-LogObservers` for more information on log observers.

    .. py:method:: addLogWithFailure(why, logprefix='')

        :param Failure why: the failure to log
        :param logprefix: prefix for the log name
        :returns: Deferred

        Add log files displaying the given failure, named ``<logprefix>err.text`` and ``<logprefix>err.html``.

    .. py:method:: addLogWithException(why, logprefix='')

        :param Exception why: the exception to log
        :param logprefix: prefix for the log name
        :returns: Deferred

        Similar to ``addLogWithFailure``, but for an Exception instead of a Failure.

    Along with logs, build steps have an associated set of links that can be used to provide additional information for developers.
    Those links are added during the build with this method:

    .. py:method:: addURL(name, url)

        :param name: URL name
        :param url: the URL

        Add a link to the given ``url``, with the given ``name`` to displays of this step.
        This allows a step to provide links to data that is not available in the log files.

LoggingBuildStep
----------------

.. py:class:: LoggingBuildStep(name, locks, haltOnFailure, flunkOnWarnings, flunkOnFailure, warnOnWarnings, warnOnFailure, alwaysRun, progressMetrics, useProgress, doStepIf, hideStepIf)

    The remaining arguments are passed to the :class:`BuildStep` constructor.

    .. warning::

        Subclasses of this class are always old-style steps.
        As such, this class will be removed after Buildbot-0.9.0.
        Instead, subclass :class:`~buildbot.process.buildstep.BuildStep` and mix in :class:`~buildbot.process.buildstep.ShellMixin` to get similar behavior.

    This subclass of :class:`BuildStep` is designed to help its subclasses run remote commands that produce standard I/O logfiles.
    It:

    * tracks progress using the length of the stdout logfile
    * provides hooks for summarizing and evaluating the command's result
    * supports lazy logfiles
    * handles the mechanics of starting, interrupting, and finishing remote commands
    * detects lost slaves and finishes with a status of
      :data:`~buildbot.process.results.RETRY`

    .. py:attribute:: logfiles

        The logfiles to track, as described for :bb:step:`ShellCommand`.
        The contents of the class-level ``logfiles`` attribute are combined with those passed to the constructor, so subclasses may add log files with a class attribute::

            class MyStep(LoggingBuildStep):
                logfiles = dict(debug='debug.log')

        Note that lazy logfiles cannot be specified using this method; they must be provided as constructor arguments.

    .. py:method:: setupLogsRunCommandAndProcessResults(cmd, stdioLog=None, closeLogWhenFinished=True, errorMessages=None, logfiles=None, lazylogfiles=False):

        :param command: the :class:`~buildbot.process.remotecommand.RemoteCommand`
            instance to start
        :param stdioLog: an optional :class:`~buildbot.process.log.Log` object where the
            stdout of the command will be stored.
        :param closeLogWhenFinished: a boolean
        :param logfiles: optional dictionary see :bb:step:`ShellCommand`
        :param lazylogfiles: optional boolean see :bb:step:`ShellCommand`

        :returns: step result from :mod:`buildbot.process.results`

        .. note::

           This method permits an optional ``errorMessages`` parameter, allowing errors detected early in the command process to be logged.
           It will be removed, and its use is deprecated.

         Handle all of the mechanics of running the given command.
         This sets up all required logfiles, and calls the utility hooks described below.

         Subclasses should use that method if they want to launch multiple commands in a single step.
         One could use that method, like for example ::

            @defer.inlineCallbacks
            def run(self):
                cmd = RemoteCommand(...)
                res = yield self.setupLogRunCommandAndProcessResults(cmd)
                if res == results.SUCCESS:
                     cmd = RemoteCommand(...)
                     res = yield self.setupLogRunCommandAndProcessResults(cmd)
                defer.returnValue(res)

    To refine the status output, override one or more of the following methods.
    The :class:`LoggingBuildStep` implementations are stubs, so there is no need to call the parent method.

    .. py:method:: commandComplete(command)

        :param command: the just-completed remote command

        This is a general-purpose hook method for subclasses.
        It will be called after the remote command has finished, but before any of the other hook functions are called.

    .. py:method:: evaluateCommand(command)

        :param command: the just-completed remote command
        :returns: step result from :mod:`buildbot.process.results`

        This hook should decide what result the step should have.

CommandMixin
------------

The :py:meth:`~buildbot.process.buildstep.BuildStep.runCommand` method can run a :py:class:`~buildbot.process.remotecommand.RemoteCommand` instance, but it's no help in building that object or interpreting the results afterward.
This mixin class adds some useful methods for running commands.

This class can only be used in new-style steps.

.. py:class:: buildbot.process.buildstep.CommandMixin

    Some remote commands are simple enough that they can boil down to a method call.
    Most of these take an ``abandonOnFailure`` argument which, if true, will abandon the entire buildstep on command failure.
    This is accomplished by raising :py:exc:`~buildbot.process.buildstep.BuildStepFailed`.

    These methods all write to the ``stdio`` log (generally just for errors).
    They do not close the log when finished.

    .. py:method:: runRmdir(dir, abandonOnFailure=True)

        :param dir: directory to remove
        :param abndonOnFailure: if true, abandon step on failure
        :returns: Boolean via Deferred

        Remove the given directory, using the ``rmdir`` command.
        Returns False on failure.

    .. py:method:: runMkdir(dir, abandonOnFailure=True)

        :param dir: directory to create
        :param abndonOnFailure: if true, abandon step on failure
        :returns: Boolean via Deferred

        Create the given directory and any parent directories, using the ``mkdir`` command.
        Returns False on failure.

    .. py:method:: pathExists(path)

        :param path: path to test
        :returns: Boolean via Deferred

        Determine if the given path exists on the slave (in any form - file, directory, or otherwise).
        This uses the ``stat`` command.

    .. py:method:: runGlob(glob)

        :param path: path to test
        :returns: list of filenames

        Get the list of files matching the given path pattern on the slave.
        This uses Python's ``glob`` module.
        If the ``glob`` method fails, it aborts the step.

    .. py:method:: getFileContentFromSlave(path, abandonOnFailure=False)

        :param path: path of the file to download from slave
        :returns: string via deferred (content of the file)

        Get the content of a file on the slave.


ShellMixin
----------

Most Buildbot steps run shell commands on the slave, and Buildbot has an impressive array of configuration parameters to control that execution.
The ``ShellMixin`` mixin provides the tools to make running shell commands easy and flexible.

This class can only be used in new-style steps.

.. py:class:: buildbot.process.buildstep.ShellMixin

    This mixin manages the following step configuration parameters, the contents of which are documented in the manual.
    Naturally, all of these are renderable.

    .. py:attribute:: command
    .. py:attribute:: workdir
    .. py:attribute:: env
    .. py:attribute:: want_stdout
    .. py:attribute:: want_stderr
    .. py:attribute:: usePTY
    .. py:attribute:: logfiles
    .. py:attribute:: lazylogfiles
    .. py:attribute:: timeout
    .. py:attribute:: maxTime
    .. py:attribute:: logEnviron
    .. py:attribute:: interruptSignal
    .. py:attribute:: sigtermTime
    .. py:attribute:: initialStdin
    .. py:attribute:: decodeRC

    .. py:method:: setupShellMixin(constructorArgs, prohibitArgs=[])

        :param dict constructorArgs: constructor keyword arguments
        :param list prohibitArgs: list of recognized arguments to reject
        :returns: keyword arguments destined for :py:class:`BuildStep`

        This method is intended to be called from the shell constructor, passed any keyword arguments not otherwise used by the step.
        Any attributes set on the instance already (e.g., class-level attributes) are used as defaults.
        Attributes named in ``prohibitArgs`` are rejected with a configuration error.

        The return value should be passed to the :py:class:`BuildStep` constructor.

    .. py:method:: makeRemoteShellCommand(collectStdout=False, collectStderr=False, \**overrides)

        :param collectStdout: if true, the command's stdout wil be available in ``cmd.stdout`` on completion
        :param collectStderr: if true, the command's stderr wil be available in ``cmd.stderr`` on completion
        :param overrides: overrides arguments that might have been passed to :py:meth:`setupShellMixin`
        :returns: :py:class:`~buildbot.process.remotecommand.RemoteShellCommand` instance via Deferred

        This method constructs a :py:class:`~buildbot.process.remotecommand.RemoteShellCommand` instance based on the instance attributes and any supplied overrides.
        It must be called while the step is running, as it examines the slave capabilities before creating the command.
        It takes care of just about everything:

         * Creating log files and associating them with the command
         * Merging environment configuration
         * Selecting the appropriate workdir configuration

        All that remains is to run the command with :py:meth:`~buildbot.process.buildstep.BuildStep.runCommand`.

    The :py:class:`ShellMixin` class implements :py:meth:`~buildbot.process.buildstep.BuildStep.getResultSummary`, returning a summary of the command.
    If no command was specified or run, it falls back to the default ``getResultSummary`` based on ``descriptionDone``.
    Subclasses can override this method to return a more appropriate status.

Exceptions
----------

.. py:exception:: BuildStepFailed

    This exception indicates that the buildstep has failed.
    It is useful as a way to skip all subsequent processing when a step goes wrong.
    It is handled by :meth:`BuildStep.failed`.
