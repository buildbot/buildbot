Buildbot Development
====================

This chapter is the official repository for the collected wisdom of the Buildbot hackers.
It is intended both for developers writing patches that will be included in Buildbot itself, and for advanced users who wish to customize Buildbot.

.. note::

    **Public API**

    Any API that is not documented in the official Buildbot documentation is considered internal and subject to change.
    If you would like in to be officially exposed, open a bug report on the `Buildbot Github project <https://github.com/buildbot/buildbot/issues>`_.
