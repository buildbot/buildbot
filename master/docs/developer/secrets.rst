Secrets
-------

.. code-block:: python

  class SecretDetails(object):
      """
      ...
      """

      def __init__(self, source, key, value):

A ``secretDetails`` is a python object initialized with a provider name, a key and a value.
Each parameter is an object property.

.. code-block:: python

  secretdetail = SecretDetails("SourceProvider", "myKey", "myValue")
  print(secretdetail.source)
  "SourceProvider"
  print(secretdetail.key)
  "myKey"
  print(secretdetail.value)
  "myValue"

A Secret is defined by a key associated to a value, returned from a provider.
Secrets returned by providers are stored in a ``secretDetails`` object.

Secrets manager
---------------

The manager is a Buildbot service manager.

.. code-block:: python

    secretsService = self.master.namedServices['secrets']
    secretDetailsList = secretsService.get(self.secrets)

The service executes a get method.
Depending on the kind of storage chosen and declared in the configuration, the manager gets the selected provider and returns a list of ``secretDetails``.

Secrets providers
-----------------

The secrets providers are implementing the specific getters, related to the storage chosen.

File provider
`````````````

.. code-block:: python

    c['secretsProviders'] = [util.SecretInAFile(dirname="/path/toSecretsFiles")]

In the master configuration the provider is instantiated through a Buildbot service secret manager with the file directory path.
File secrets provider reads the file named by the key wanted by Buildbot and returns the contained text value (removing trailing newlines if present).
SecretInAFile provider allows Buildbot to read secrets in the secret directory.

Vault provider
``````````````

.. code-block:: python

    c['secretsProviders'] = [util.SecretInVault(vaultToken=open('VAULT_TOKEN').read(),
                                                vaultServer="http://localhost:8200"
                                                )]

In the master configuration, the provider is instantiated through a Buildbot service secret manager with the Vault token and the Vault server address.
Vault secrets provider accesses the Vault backend asking the key wanted by Buildbot and returns the contained text value.
SecretInVAult provider allows Buildbot to read secrets in the Vault.

Secret Obfuscation
``````````````````

Secrets are never visible to the normal user via logs and thus are transmitted directly to the workers, using :class:`Obfuscated`.
The class Obfuscated replaces secret string value by ``####`` characters when the secret value is logged.
