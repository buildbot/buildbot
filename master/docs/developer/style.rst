Buildbot Coding Style
=====================

Documentation
-------------

Buildbot strongly encourages developers to document the methods, behavior, and usage of classes that users might interact with.
However, this documentation should be in ``.rst`` files under ``master/docs/developer``, rather than in docstrings within the code.
For private methods or where code deserves some kind of explanatory preface, use comments instead of a docstring.
While some docstrings remain within the code, these should be migrated to documentation files and removed as the code is modified.

Within the reStructuredText files, write with each English sentence on its own line.
While this does not affect the generated output, it makes git diffs between versions of the documentation easier to read, as they are not obscured by changes due to re-wrapping.
This convention is not followed everywhere, but we are slowly migrating documentation from the old (wrapped) style as we update it.

Symbol Names
------------

Buildbot follows `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ regarding the formatting of symbol names.
Because Buildbot uses Twisted so heavily, and Twisted uses interCaps, this is not very consistently applied throughout the codebase.

The single exception to PEP8 is in naming of functions and methods.
That is, you should spell methods and functions with the first character in lower-case, and the first letter of subsequent words capitalized, e.g., ``compareToOther`` or ``getChangesGreaterThan``.

Symbols used as parameters to functions used in configuration files should use underscores.

In summary, then:

====================== ============
Symbol Type            Format
====================== ============
Methods                interCaps
Functions              interCaps
Function Arguments     under_scores
API method Arguments   interCaps
Classes                InitialCaps
Variables              under_scores
Constants              ALL_CAPS
====================== ============

Twisted Idioms
--------------

Programming with Twisted Python can be daunting.  But sticking to a few
well-defined patterns can help avoid surprises.

Prefer to Return Deferreds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're writing a method that doesn't currently block, but could conceivably
block sometime in the future, return a Deferred and document that it does so.
Just about anything might block - even getters and setters!

Helpful Twisted Classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Twisted has some useful, but little-known classes.
Brief descriptions follow, but you should consult the API documentation or source code
for the full details.

:class:`twisted.internet.task.LoopingCall`
    Calls an asynchronous function repeatedly at set intervals.
    Note that this will stop looping if the function fails.
    In general, you will want to wrap the function to capture and log errors.

:class:`twisted.application.internet.TimerService`
    Similar to ``t.i.t.LoopingCall``, but implemented as a service that will automatically start and stop the function calls when the service starts and stops.
    See the warning about failing functions for ``t.i.t.LoopingCall``.

Sequences of Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Especially in Buildbot, we're often faced with executing a sequence of
operations, many of which may block.

In all cases where this occurs, there is a danger of pre-emption, so exercise
the same caution you would if writing a threaded application.

For simple cases, you can use nested callback functions. For more complex cases, inlineCallbacks is appropriate.
In all cases, please prefer maintainability and readability over performance.

Nested Callbacks
................

First, an admonition: do not create extra class methods that represent the continuations of the first:


.. code-block:: python

    def myMethod(self):
        d = ...
        d.addCallback(self._myMethod_2) # BAD!
    def _myMethod_2(self, res):         # BAD!
        ...

Invariably, this extra method gets separated from its parent as the code
evolves, and the result is completely unreadable. Instead, include all of the
code for a particular function or method within the same indented block, using
nested functions:

.. code-block:: python

    def getRevInfo(revname):
        # for example only! See above a better implementation with inlineCallbacks
        results = {}
        d = defer.succeed(None)
        def rev_parse(_): # note use of '_' to quietly indicate an ignored parameter
            return utils.getProcessOutput(git, [ 'rev-parse', revname ])
        d.addCallback(rev_parse)
        def parse_rev_parse(res):
            results['rev'] = res.strip()
            return utils.getProcessOutput(git, [ 'log', '-1', '--format=%s%n%b', results['rev'] ])
        d.addCallback(parse_rev_parse)
        def parse_log(res):
            results['comments'] = res.strip()
        d.addCallback(parse_log)
        def set_results(_):
            return results
        d.addCallback(set_results)
        return d

it is usually best to make the first operation occur within a callback, as the
deferred machinery will then handle any exceptions as a failure in the outer
Deferred.  As a shortcut, ``d.addCallback`` works as a decorator:

.. code-block:: python

    d = defer.succeed(None)
    @d.addCallback
    def rev_parse(_): # note use of '_' to quietly indicate an ignored parameter
        return utils.getProcessOutput(git, [ 'rev-parse', revname ])

.. note::

    ``d.addCallback`` is not really a decorator as it does not return a modified function.
    As a result in previous code, ``rev_parse`` value is actually the Deferred.
    In general the :class:`inlineCallbacks` method is preferred inside new code as it keeps the code easier to read.
    As a general rule of thumb, when you need more than 2 callbacks in the same method, it's time to switch it to  :class:`inlineCallbacks`.
    This would be for example the case for previous :py:func:`getRevInfo`.
    See this `discussion <https://github.com/buildbot/buildbot/pull/2523>`_ with Twisted experts for more information.

Be careful with local variables. For example, if ``parse_rev_parse``, above,
merely assigned ``rev = res.strip()``, then that variable would be local to
``parse_rev_parse`` and not available in ``set_results``. Mutable variables
(dicts and lists) at the outer function level are appropriate for this purpose.

.. note:: do not try to build a loop in this style by chaining multiple
    Deferreds!  Unbounded chaining can result in stack overflows, at least on older
    versions of Twisted. Use ``inlineCallbacks`` instead.

In most of the cases if you need more than two callbacks in a method, it is more readable and maintainable to use inlineCallbacks.

inlineCallbacks
...............

:class:`twisted.internet.defer.inlineCallbacks` is a great help to writing code
that makes a lot of asynchronous calls, particularly if those calls are made in
loop or conditionals.  Refer to the Twisted documentation for the details, but
the style within Buildbot is as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from twisted.internet import defer

    @defer.inlineCallbacks
    def mymethod(self, x, y):
        xval = yield getSomething(x)

        for z in (yield getZValues()):
            y += z

        if xval > 10:
            defer.returnValue(xval + y)
            return

        self.someOtherMethod()

The key points to notice here:

* Always import ``defer`` as a module, not the names within it.
* Use the decorator form of ``inlineCallbacks``.
* In most cases, the result of a ``yield`` expression should be assigned to a
  variable.  It can be used in a larger expression, but remember that Python
  requires that you enclose the expression in its own set of parentheses.
* Python does not permit returning a value from a generator, so statements like
  ``return xval + y`` are invalid.  Instead, yield the result of
  ``defer.returnValue``.  Although this function does cause an immediate
  function exit, for clarity follow it with a bare ``return``, as in
  the example, unless it is the last statement in a function.

The great advantage of ``inlineCallbacks`` is that it allows you to use all
of the usual Pythonic control structures in their natural form. In particular,
it is easy to represent a loop, or even nested loops, in this style without
losing any readability.

Note that code using ``deferredGenerator`` is no longer acceptable in Buildbot.

The previous :py:func:`getRevInfo` example implementation should rather be written as:

.. code-block:: python

    @defer.inlineCallbacks
    def getRevInfo(revname):
        results = {}
        res = yield utils.getProcessOutput(git, [ 'rev-parse', revname ])
        results['rev'] = res.strip()
        res = yield utils.getProcessOutput(git, [ 'log', '-1', '--format=%s%n%b', results['rev'] ])
        results['comments'] = res.strip()
        defer.returnValue(results)

Locking
.......

Remember that asynchronous programming does not free you from the need to worry
about concurrency issues.  Particularly if you are executing a sequence of
operations, each time you wait for a Deferred, arbitrary other actions can take
place.

In general, you should try to perform actions atomically, but for the rare
situations that require synchronization, the following might be useful:

* :py:class:`twisted.internet.defer.DeferredLock`
* :py:func:`buildbot.util.misc.deferredLocked`

Joining Sequences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's often the case that you'll want to perform multiple operations in
parallel, and re-join the results at the end. For this purpose, you'll want to
use a `DeferredList <http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.internet.defer.DeferredList.html>`_
:

.. code-block:: python

    def getRevInfo(revname):
        results = {}
        finished = dict(rev_parse=False, log=False)

        rev_parse_d = utils.getProcessOutput(git, [ 'rev-parse', revname ])
        def parse_rev_parse(res):
            return res.strip()
        rev_parse_d.addCallback(parse_rev_parse)

        log_d = utils.getProcessOutput(git, [ 'log', '-1', '--format=%s%n%b', results['rev'] ])
        def parse_log(res):
            return res.strip()
        log_d.addCallback(parse_log)

        d = defer.DeferredList([rev_parse_d, log_d], consumeErrors=1, fireOnFirstErrback=1)
        def handle_results(results):
            return dict(rev=results[0][1], log=results[1][1])
        d.addCallback(handle_results)
        return d

Here the deferred list will wait for both ``rev_parse_d`` and ``log_d`` to
fire, or for one of them to fail. You may attach callbacks and errbacks to a
``DeferredList`` just as for a deferred.

Functions running outside of the main thread
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is very important in Twisted to be able to distinguish functions that runs in the main thread and functions that don't, as reactors and deferreds can only be used in the main thread.
To make this distinction clearer, every functions meant to be started in a secondary thread must be prefixed with ``thd_``.
