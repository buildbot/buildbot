==============================
First Buildbot run with Docker
==============================

Docker_ is an awesome tool that makes building and deploying custom environments
a breeze. It uses light linux containers and perform fast, making it a great
instrument for the testing community.
The next section includes a Docker pre-flight check. If it takes more that 3
minutes to get the 'Success' message for you, please return to the Buildbot
pip-based :ref:`first run <getting-code-label>`.

.. _Docker: http://www.docker.io


Current Docker dependencies
---------------------------

* Linux system, with at least kernel 3.8 and AUFS support. For example,
  Standard Ubuntu, Debian and Arch systems.
* Packages: lxc, iptables, ca-certificates, and bzip2 packages
* Local clock on time or slightly in the future for proper SSL communication
* Download, launch and test docker is happy in your linux enviroment:

.. code-block:: bash

  mkdir tmp; cd tmp
  wget -O docker http://get.docker.io/builds/Linux/x86_64/docker-latest
  chmod 755 docker; sudo ./docker -d &
  sudo ./docker run -i busybox /bin/echo Success


Building and running Buildbot
-----------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

  # Download Buildbot Dockerfile.
  wget https://raw.github.com/buildbot/buildbot/master/master/contrib/Dockerfile

  # Build the Buildbot container (it will take a few minutes to download packages)
  sudo ./docker build -t buildbot - < Dockerfile

  # Run buildbot
  CONTAINER_ID=$(sudo ./docker run -d buildbot)


You should now be able to go to http://localhost:8010 and see a web page
similar to:

.. image:: _images/index.png
   :alt: index page

Click on the
`Waterfall Display link <http://localhost:8010/waterfall>`_
and you get this:

.. image:: _images/waterfall-empty.png
   :alt: empty waterfall.


Playing with your Buildbot container
------------------------------------

If you've got this far, you have a great playground at your fingertips where
you can effortlessly learn Buildbot and tweak its configuration to meet your needs.

You can access your container using ssh  (username: admin   password: admin):

.. code-block:: bash

  ssh -p $(sudo ./docker port $CONTAINER_ID 22) admin@localhost


You've got a taste now, but you're probably curious for more.  Let's step it
up a little in the second tutorial by changing the configuration and doing
an actual build. Continue on to :ref:`quick-tour-label`
