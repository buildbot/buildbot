A Quick Tour
============

Goal
----

This tutorial will expand on the :ref:`first-run-label` tutorial by taking a
quick tour around some of the features of buildbot that are hinted at in the
comments in the sample configuration.  We will simply change parts of the
default configuration and explain the activated features.

As a part of this tutorial, we will make buildbot do a few actual builds.

This section will teach you how to:
 - make simple configuration changes and activate them
 - deal with configuration errors
 - force builds
 - enable and control the IRC bot
 - enable ssh debugging

Setting Project Name and URL
----------------------------

Let's start simple by looking at where you would customize the buildbot's project name and URL.

We continue where we left off in the :ref:`first-run-label` tutorial.

Open a new terminal, and first enter the same sandbox you created before (where $EDITOR is your editor of choice like vim, gedit, or emacs)::

  cd
  cd tmp/buildbot
  source sandbox/bin/activate
  $EDITOR master/master.cfg

Now, look for the section marked *PROJECT IDENTITY* which reads::

  ####### PROJECT IDENTITY

  # the 'projectName' string will be used to describe the project that this
  # buildbot is working on. For example, it is used as the title of the
  # waterfall HTML page. The 'projectURL' string will be used to provide a link
  # from buildbot HTML pages to your project's home page.

  c['projectName'] = "Pyflakes"
  c['projectURL'] = "http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodPyflakes"

If you want, you can change either of these links to anything you want to see what happens when you change them. 
After making a change go into the terminal and type::

  buildbot reconfig master

You will see a handful of lines of output from the master log, much like this::

  2009-08-01 13:38:21+0200 [-] loading configuration from /home/thomas/dev/ext/buildbot/sandbox/master/master.cfg

  2009-08-01 13:38:21+0200 [-] configuration update complete

  Reconfiguration appears to have completed successfully.

The important lines are the ones telling you that it is loading the new
configuration at the top, and the one at the bottom saying that the update
is complete.

Now, if you go back to
`the waterfall page <http://localhost:8010/waterfall>`_,
you will see that the project's name is whatever you may have changed it to and when you click on the 
the URL of the project name at the bottom of the page it should take you to the link you put in the configuration.

Configuration Errors
--------------------

It is very common to make a mistake when configuring buildbot, so you might
as well see now what happens in that case and what you can do to fix
the error.

Open up the config again and introduce a syntax error by removing the first
single quote in the two lines you changed, so they read::

  c[projectName'] = "Pyflakes"
  c['projectURL'] = "http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodPyflakes"

This creates a Python SyntaxError.  Now go ahead and reconfig the buildmaster::

  buildbot reconfig master

This time, the output looks like::

  2009-08-01 13:52:23+0200 [-] loading configuration from /home/thomas/dev/ext/buildbot/sandbox/master/master.cfg
  2009-08-01 13:52:23+0200 [-] error while parsing config file

  2009-08-01 13:52:23+0200 [-] The new config file is unusable, so I'll ignore it.
  2009-08-01 13:52:23+0200 [-] I will keep using the previous config file instead.

  Reconfiguration failed. Please inspect the master.cfg file for errors,
  correct them, then try 'buildbot reconfig' again.

This time, it's clear that there was a mistake. in the configuration.
Luckily, the buildbot master will ignore the wrong configuration and keep
running with the previous configuration.

The message is clear enough, so open the configuration again, fix the error,
and reconfig the master. 

*Note that if you are not using 0.8.4 you might experience an error during reconfig with clean configs, 
this is due to* `<http://trac.buildbot.net/ticket/1757>`_ *which if fixed and will be in the 0.8.4 package. 
If you come across this, just do start & stop for now to get your buildbot instance updated*::

  buildbot stop master && buildbot start master

Your First Build
---------------

By now you're probably thinking: "All this time spent and still not done a
single build ? What was the name of this project again ?"

On the `waterfall <http://localhost:8010/waterfall>`_. page, click on the runtests link, and scroll down.  You will see
some new options that allow you to force a build:

.. image:: _images/force-build.png
   :alt: force a build.

Type in your name and a reason, then click *Force Build*.  After that, click
on
`view in waterfall <http://localhost:8010/waterfall?show=runtests>`_.

You will now see:

.. image:: _images/runtests-success.png
   :alt: an successful test run happened.

Enabling the IRC Bot
--------------------

Buildbot includes and IRC bot that you can tell to join a channel and control
to report on the status of buildbot.

First, start an IRC client of your choice, connect to irc.freenode.org and
join an empty channel.  In this example we will use #buildbot-test, so go
join that channel. (*Note: please do not join the main buildbot channel!*)

Edit the config and look for the *STATUS TARGETS* section that you changed
before to be able to force the build.

Enter these lines below the WebStatus line in master.cfg::

  c['status'].append(html.WebStatus(http_port=8010, authz=authz_cfg))

  from buildbot.status import words
  c['status'].append(words.IRC(host="irc.freenode.org", nick="bbtest",
                               channels=["#buildbot-test"]))

Reconfigure the build master then do::

  cat master/twistd.log | grep IRC

The log output should contain a line like this::

  2009-08-01 15:35:20+0200 [-] adding IStatusReceiver <buildbot.status.words.IRC instance at 0x300d290>

You should see the bot now joining in your IRC client.
Type::

  bbtest: commands

to get a list of the commands the bot supports.

Let's tell the bot to notify certain events, to learn which EVENTS we can notify on do::

  bbtest: help notify

Now let's set some event notifications::

  bbtest: notify on started
  bbtest: notify on finished
  bbtest: notify on failure

The bot should have responded to each of the commands::

<@lsblakk> bbtest: notify on started
<bbtest> The following events are being notified: ['started']
<@lsblakk> bbtest: notify on finished
<bbtest> The following events are being notified: ['started', 'finished']
<@lsblakk> bbtest: notify on failure
<bbtest> The following events are being notified: ['started', 'failure', 'finished']

Now, go back to the web interface and force another build.

Notice how the bot tells you about the start and finish of this build::

  < bbtest> build #1 of runtests started, including []
  < bbtest> build #1 of runtests is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://localhost:8010/builders/runtests/builds/1

You can also use the bot to force a build::

  bbtest: force build runtests test build

This time, the bot is giving you more output, as it's specifically responding
to your direct request to force a build, and explicitly tells you when the
build finishes::

  <@lsblakk> bbtest: force build runtests test build
  < bbtest> build #2 of runtests started, including []
  < bbtest> build forced [ETA 0 seconds]
  < bbtest> I'll give a shout when the build finishes
  < bbtest> build #2 of runtests is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://localhost:8010/builders/runtests/builds/2

You can also see the new builds in the web interface.

.. image:: _images/irc-testrun.png
   :alt: a successful test run from IRC happened.

Debugging with Manhole
--------------------------
You can do some debugging by using manhole, an interactive Python shell. 
It exposes full access to the buildmaster's account (including the ability to modify and delete files), so it should 
not be enabled with a weak or easily guessable password. 

To use this you will need to install an additional package to your virtualenv::

  # make sure your sandbox is activated so this is installed in your virtualenv
  pip install pycrypto
  pip install pyans1

In your master.cfg find::

  c = BuildmasterConfig = {}
  
Insert the following to enable debugging mode with manhole::

  ####### DEBUGGING
  from buildbot import manhole
  c['manhole'] = manhole.PasswordManhole("tcp:1234:interface=127.0.0.1","admin","passwd")
  
Now you can ssh into the master and get an interactive python shell::

  ssh -p1234 admin@127.0.0.1
  # enter passwd at prompt

If you wanted to check which slaves are connected and what builders those slaves are assigned to you could do::

  >>> master.botmaster.slaves
  {'example-slave': <BuildSlave 'example-slave', current builders: runtests>}

The master can be explored in more depther using dir().
