For advanced users, Buildbot acts as a framework supporting a customized build
framework.  For the most part, such configurations consist of subclasses set up
for use in a regular Buildbot configuration file.

This chapter describes the varieties of subclasses that are supported, and how
to write them.  For the most part, the interfaces themselves are documented in
the API documentation.
