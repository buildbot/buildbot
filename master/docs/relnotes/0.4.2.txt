Buildbot-0.4.2 was released 08 Jan 2004

** test suite updated

The test suite has been completely moved over to Twisted's "Trial"
framework, and all tests now pass. To run the test suite (consisting of 64
tests, probably covering about 30% of Buildbot's logic), do this:

 PYTHONPATH=. trial -v buildbot.test

** Mail parsers updated

Several bugs in the mail-parsing code were fixed, allowing a buildmaster to
be triggered by mail sent out by a CVS repository. (The Twisted Buildbot is
now using this to trigger builds, as their CVS server machine is having some
difficulties with FreshCVS). The FreshCVS mail format for directory
additions appears to have changed recently: the new parser should handle
both old and new-style messages.

A parser for Bonsai commit messages (buildbot.changes.mail.parseBonsaiMail)
was contributed by Stephen Davis. Thanks Stephen!

** CVS "global options" now available

The CVS build step can now accept a list of "global options" to give to the
cvs command. These go before the "update"/"checkout" word, and are described
fully by "cvs --help-options". Two useful ones might be "-r", which causes
checked-out files to be read-only, and "-R", which assumes the repository is
read-only (perhaps by not attempting to write to lock files).
