* Fix incompatibility with MySQL-5.7 (:bug:`3421`)
* Fix incompatibility with postgresql driver psycopg2 (:bug:`3419`, further regressions will be caught by travis)
* Fix regressions in forcescheduler UI (:bug:`3416`, :bug:`3418`, :bug:`3422`)

Deprecations, Removals, and Non-Compatible Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The ``buildbot`` Python dist now (finally) requires SQLAlchemy-0.8.0 or later and SQLAlchemy-Migrate-0.9.0 or later.
  While the old pinned versions (0.7.10 and 0.7.2, respectively) still work, this compatibility is no longer tested and this configuration should be considered deprecated.
