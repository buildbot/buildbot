Buildbot 0.8.2 was released 29 Oct 2010

** Upgrading

Upgrading to from the previous version will require an 'upgrade-master' run.
However, the schema changes are backward-compatible, so if a downgrade is
required, it will not be difficult.

** New Requirements

The Buildmaster now requires Jinja-2.1 or higher.

Both master and slave now require Twisted-8.0.0.  Although Twisted-2.5.0 may
still work, it is not tested and not supported.

** Command-line options changed

To resolve conflicting command-line options (ticket #972) for sendchange
command the following changes were done:

 * `-m` option now means `--master`
 * `-c` option now means `--comments`
 * `-C` option now means `--category`

Added new `-n|--no-logrotate` flag to create-master command which disables
internal logging and log rotation mechanism in buildbot.tac (ticket #973)

** MasterShellCommand semantics change

The MasterShellCommand now provides the buildmaster's environment to the step
by default; pass env={} to pass a clean environment, instead.

** Log Rotation

The default 'create-master' output now rotates ten twistd.log files, each of
about 10MiB.  This is a change from older versions, which would rotate an
unbounded number of 1MiB files.

** New configuration key, 'changeCacheSize'

This sets the number of changes that buildbot will keep in memory at once.
Users of distributed version control systems should consider setting this to a
high value (e.g. 10,000)

** New libvirt-based Latent Buildslave Support

This extends the support already included for EC2 buildslaves to include any
virtualization platform supported by libvirt.

** Canceling Pending Builds for a Change

Change pages on the webstatus now have buttons to cancel any pending
builds that include that change (across all builders). The corresponding
authz privilege to control access to this feature is 'stopChange'.

** New Change source

*** CVSMaildirSource

This parses mail sent by buildbot_cvs_mail.py in contrib directory.
See docs for more info.

** New Steps

*** VC++ 9, VS2008, VCExpress9 - part of the vstudio suite of steps

** Deprecations and Removals

*** Removed sendchange's --revision_number argument (use --revision)

*** Deprecating old CVS MairdirSources:
    Please post to the list if you are using
      FreshCVS   FCMaildirSource
      Syncmail   SyncmailMaildirSource
      Bonsai     BonsaiMaildirSource

*** statusgui is deprecated in this version and will be removed in the next
release.  Please file a bug at http://buildbot.net if you wish to reverse this
decision.

*** The Twisted-only steps BuildDebs and ProcessDocs have been removed.

* Slave Changes

** Log Rotation

The default 'create-slave' output now rotates ten twistd.log files, each of
about 10MiB.  This is a change from older versions, which would rotate an
unbounded number of 1MiB files.

** twistd.hostname

On startup, the buildslave writes its hostname to twistd.hostname.  This is
intended to contextualize twistd.pid, which does not specify the host on which
the buildslave is running.
