Buildbot 0.8.0 was released 25 May 2010

** (NOTE!) Scheduler requires keyword arguments

If you are creating your Scheduler like this:

  Scheduler("mysched", "mybranch", 0, ["foo", "bar"])

then it's time to change that to specify each of the arguments with a keyword:

  Scheduler(name="mysched", branch="mybranch",
        treeStableTimer=0, builderNames=["foo", "bar"])

** Database Backend

Scheduler, change, and build request information is now stored in a database -
by default, in SQLite, although MySQL is also supported.  With this change,
scheduled builds will persist over buildmaster restarts, as will
interrelationships between schedulers (e.g., Triggerable and Dependent).

Upgrading to the new database backend is easy, although it brings additional
requirements on the buildmaster.  See the Buildbot documentation for more
information.

** Visual Studio / VC++ Compile Steps

** New Change/SourceStamp attributes 'project' and 'repository'

These attributes can be used to further refine matching by schedulers.
Repository completes the SourceStamp: the tuple of (repository, branch,
revision) completely specifies a source code tree.  Likewise, the project
attribute can be used to support building several distinct projects within one
buildmaster, replacing the use of category for this purpose.  Matching can be
done using regular expressions, so it's even possible to support nested
projects!

** ShellCommands expand environment variables

If you pass to a shell command an environment variable like this:

ShellCommand(..., env={"FOO": "${BAR}"})

then, on the slave side the variable FOO will have the same value as
the alread existing BAR variable on the slave. This is mostly used to
expand variable like this: "PATH": "/my/directory:${PATH}" where PATH
will have "/my/directory" prepended to it.

** Builders can setup properties

There is a new parameter to the builders to setup properties on a
per-builder basis.

** New /json web status

This view has lots of useful information perfectly formed for serving as input
to JavaScript status displays.  See /json/help for details.

** Jinja

All web status is now generated using the Jinja templating engine, which gives
buildbot a much more attractive and maintainable appearance.  Buildbot's output
is also now XHTML-compliant!

** Authorization Framework

The web-based status displays now provide fine-grained control over who can
do what - force builds, stop builds, cancel builds, etc.  See the manual for
configuration details.

** Mercurial uses full revisions

Mercurial now sets got_revision to the full 40-character revision id instead of
the short IDs.

** Cleanup, Bug Fixes, and Test Fixes

Thanks to help from a number of devoted contributors, this version of Buildbot
has seen a lot of house-cleaning, and even passes all of its own unit tests!  

** Removals

*** Removed buildbot.status.html.Waterfall (deprecated in 0.7.6)

Note that this does not remove the waterfall -- just an old version of it which
did not include the rest of the WebStatus pages.

*** BuildmasterConfig no longer accepts 'bots' and 'sources' as keys
(deprecated in 0.7.6). Use 'slaves' and 'change_source' instead.
