Release Notes

    Don't write to this file anymore!!

    Buildbot now uses towncrier to manage its release notes.
    towncrier helps to avoid the need for rebase when several people work at the same time on the releasenote files.

    Each PR should come with a file in the master/buildbot/newsfragment directory

Buildbot ``0.9.3`` ( ``2017-01-11`` )
===================================================

Bug fixes
---------

- Fix :bb:reporter:`BitbucketStatusPush` ``ep should start with /`` assertion
  error.
- Fix duplicate worker use case, where a worker with the same name would make
  the other worker also disconnect (:bug:`3656`)
- :py:class:`~buildbot.changes.GitPoller`: ``buildPushesWithNoCommits`` now
  rebuilds for a known branch that was updated to an existing commit.
- Fix issue with log viewer not staying at bottom of the log when loading log
  lines.
- Fixed `addBuildURLs` in :py:class:`~buildbot.steps.trigger.Trigger` to use
  results from triggered builds to include in the URL name exposed by API.
- Fix :ref:`mq-Wamp` :bb:cfg:`mq` support by removing ``debug``, ``debug_amp``
  and ``debug_app`` from the :bb:cfg:`mq` config, which is not available in
  latest version of `Python Autobahn <http://autobahn.ws>`_. You can now use
  ``wamp_debug_level`` option instead.
- fix issue with factory.workdir AttributeError are not properly reported.

Features
--------

- Optimize the memory consumption of the log compression process. Buildbot do
  not load the whole log into memory anymore. This should improve a lot
  buildbot memory footprint.
- Changed the build page so that the preview of the logs are shown in live. It
  is a preview means the last lines of log. How many lines is configurable per
  user in the user settings page.
- Log viewer line numbers are no longer selectable, so that it is easier to
  copy paste.
- :py:class:`~buildbot.plugins.worker.DockerLatentWorker` accepts now
  renderable Dockerfile
- :ref:`Renderer` function can now return
  :class:`~buildbot.interfaces.IRenderable` objects.
- new :bb:step:`SetProperties` which allows to generate and transform
  properties separately.
- Handle new workers in `windows_service.py` script.
- Sort the builders in the waterfall view by name instead of ID.


Buildbot ``0.9.2`` ( ``2016-12-13`` )
===================================================

Bug fixes
---------

- Fix :py:class:`~buildbot.www.oauth2.GitHubAuth` to retrieve all organizations
  instead of only those publicly available.
- Fixed `ref` to point to `branch` instead of commit `sha` in
  :py:class:`~buildbot.reporters.GitlabStatusPush`
- :bb:reporter:`IRC` :py:meth:`maybeColorize` is able to highlight single words
  and stop colorization at the end. The previous implementation only stopped
  colorization but not boldface.
- fix compatibility issue with mysql5 (do not set default value for TEXT
  column).
- Fixed `addChange` in :py:class:`~buildbot.data.changes.Change` to use the
  `revlink` configuration option to generate the revlink.

  <https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/>`_ via
  :py:class:`~buildbot.plugins.worker.MarathonLatentWorker`. ``Marathon`` is a
  production-grade container orchestration platform for Mesosphere's Data-
  center Operating System (DC/OS) and Apache ``Mesos``.
- ``password`` in :py:class:`~buildbot.plugins.worker.DockerLatentWorker` and
  :py:class:`~buildbot.plugins.worker.HyperLatentWorker`, can be None. In that
  case, they will be auto-generated from random number.
