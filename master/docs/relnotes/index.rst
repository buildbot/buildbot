    Buildbot now uses towncrier to manage its release notes.
    towncrier helps to avoid the need for rebase when several people work at the same time on the releasenote files.

    Each PR should come with a file in the master/buildbot/newsfragment directory

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

  Notably, Internet Explorer 11 is no longer supported.
  Currently supported browsers are Chrome 56, Firefox 52, Edge 13 and Safari 10, newer versions of these browsers and their compatible derivatives.
  This set of browsers covers 98% of users of buildbot.net.


Buildbot ``2.3.1`` ( ``2019-05-22`` )
=====================================

Bug fixes
---------

- Fix vulnerability in OAuth where user-submitted authorization token was used for authentication
  (https://github.com/buildbot/buildbot/wiki/OAuth-vulnerability-in-using-submitted-authorization-token-for-authentication)
  Thanks to Phillip Kuhrt for reporting it.

Buildbot ``2.3.0`` ( ``2019-05-06`` )
=====================================

Highlights
----------

- Support for older browsers has been hopefully temporarily broken due to frontend changes in progress.
  Notably, Internet Explorer 11 is not supported in this release.
  Currently supported browsers are Chrome 56, Firefox 52, Edge 13 and Safari 10, newer versions of these browsers and their compatible derivatives.
  This set of browsers covers 98% of users of buildbot.net.

Bug fixes
---------

- Latent workers with negative `build_wait_timeout` will be shutdown on master shutdown.
- Latent worker will now wait until `start_instance()` before starting `stop_instance()` or vice-versa. Master will wait for these functions to finish during shutdown.
- Latent worker will now correctly handle synchronous exception from the backend worker driver.
- Fixed a potential error during database migration when upgrading to versions >=2.0 (:issue:`4711`).

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- The implementation language of the Buildbot web frontend has been changed from CoffeeScript to JavaScript.
  The documentation has not been updated yet, as we plan to transition to TypeScript.
  In the transitory period support for some browsers, notably IE 11 has been dropped.
  We hope to bring support for older browsers back once the transitory period is over.
- The support for building Buildbot using npm as package manager has been removed.
  Please use yarn as a replacement that is used by Buildbot developers.

- Worker to Master protocol can now be encrypted via TLS.

Bug fixes
---------

- To avoid database corruption, the ``upgrade-master`` command now ignores all
  signals except ``SIGKILL``. It cannot be interrupted with ``ctrl-c``
  (:issue:`4600`).
- Fixed incorrect tracking of latent worker states that could sometimes result
  in duplicate ``stop_instance`` calls and so on.
- Fixed a race condition that could manifest in cancelled substantiations if
  builds were created during insubstantiation of a latent worker.
- Perforce CLI Rev. 2018.2/1751184 (2019/01/21) is now supported
  (:issue:`4574`).

Buildbot ``2.0.0`` ( ``2019-02-02`` )
=====================================

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- Removed support for Python <3.5 in the buildbot master code.
  Buildbot worker remains compatible with python2.7, and interoperability tests are run continuously.
- APIs that are not documented in the official Buildbot documentation have been
  made private. Users of these undocumented APIs are encouraged to file bugs to
  get them exposed.
- Removed support of old slave APIs from pre-0.9 days. Using old APIs may fail
  silently. To avoid weird errors when upgrading a Buildbot installation that
  may use old APIs, first upgrade to to 1.8.0 and make sure there are no
  deprecated API warnings.
- Remove deprecated default value handling of the ``keypair_name`` and
  ``security_name`` attributes of ``EC2LatentWorker``.
- Support for ``Hyper.sh`` containers cloud provider has been removed as this
  service has shutdown.

Bug fixes
---------

- Fix CRLF injection vulnerability with validating user provided redirect parameters (https://github.com/buildbot/buildbot/wiki/CRLF-injection-in-Buildbot-login-and-logout-redirect-code)
  Thanks to ``mik317`` and ``mariadb`` for reporting it.

- Fix lockup during master shutdown when there's a build with unanswered ping
  from the worker and the TCP connection to worker is severed (issue:`4575`).
- Fix RemoteUserAuth.maybeAutLogin consumes bytes object as str leading to
  TypeError during JSON serialization. (:issue:`4402`)
- Various database integrity problems were fixed. Most notably, it is now
  possible to delete old changes without wiping all "child" changes in cascade
  (:issue:`4539`, :pull:`4536`).
- The GitLab change hook secret is now rendered correctly. (:issue:`4118`).

Features
--------

- Identifiers can now contain UTF-8 characters which are not ASCII. This
  includes worker names, builder names, and step names.
