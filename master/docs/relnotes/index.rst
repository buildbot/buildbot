Release Notes for Buildbot |version|
====================================

..
    Any change that adds a feature or fixes a bug should have an entry here.
    Most simply need an additional bulleted list item, but more significant
    changes can be given a subsection of their own.

..
    NOTE: When releasing 0.9.0, combine these notes with those from 0.9.0b{1,2,3,4,5}
    into one single set of notes.  Also, link prominently to the migration guide.

The following are the release notes for Buildbot |version|

See :ref:`Upgrading to Nine` for a guide to upgrading from 0.8.x to 0.9.x

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Note that Buildbot is not yet compatible with MySQL-5.7.
  See :bug:`3421` for status and to help out.

* The ``buildbot`` Python dist now (finally) requires SQLAlchemy-0.8.0 or later and SQLAlchemy-Migrate-0.9.0 or later.
  While the old pinned versions (0.7.10 and 0.7.2, respectively) still work, this compatibility is no longer tested and this configuration should be considered deprecated.
