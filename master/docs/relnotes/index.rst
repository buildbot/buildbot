Release Notes for Buildbot |version|
====================================

..
    Any change that adds a feature or fixes a bug should have an entry here.
    Most simply need an additional bulleted list item, but more significant
    changes can be given a subsection of their own.

The following are the release notes for Buildbot |version|.

* The ``MasterShellCommand`` step now correctly handles environment variables passed as list.

Master
------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* The :bb:status:`IRC` bot now supports clean shutdown and immediate shutdown by using the command 'shutdown'.
  To allow the command to function, you must provide `allowShutdown=True`.

* :bb:step:`CopyDirectory` has been added.

* default.css now wraps preformatted text by default.

Deprecations, Removals, and Non-Compatible Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The ``split_file`` function for :bb:chsrc:`SVNPoller` may now return a dictionary instead of a tuple.
  This allows it to add extra information about a change (such as ``project`` or ``repository``).
* The ``workdir`` property has been renamed to ``builddir``.
* The ``Blocker`` step has been removed.

* StatusReceivers' checkConfig method should no longer take an `errors` parameter.
  It should indicate errors by calling :py:func:`~buildbot.config.error`.

* Build steps now require that their name be a string.
  Previously, they would accept anything, but not behave appropriately.

* The web status no longer displays a potentially misleading message, indicating whether the build
  can be rebuilt exactly.

Changes for Developers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added an optional build start callback to ``buildbot.status.status_gerrit.GerritStatusPush``

* An optional ``startCB`` callback to :bb:status:`GerritStatusPush` can be used
  to send a message back to the committer.
  See the linked documentation for details.
