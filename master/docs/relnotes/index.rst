Buildbot ``1.5.0`` ( ``2018-10-09`` )
=====================================

Bug fixes
---------

- Fix the umask parameter example to make it work with both Python 2.x and 3.x.
- Fix build-change association for multi-codebase builds in the console view..
- Fixed builders page doesn't list workers in multi-master configuration
  (:issue:`4326`)
- Restricted groups added by :py:class:`~buildbot.www.oauth2.GitHubAuth`'s
  ``getTeamsMembership`` option to only those teams to which the user belongs.
  Previously, groups were added for all teams for all organizations to which
  the user belongs.
- Fix 'Show old workers' combo behavior.

Features
--------

- GitHub teams added to a user's ``groups`` by
  :py:class:`~buildbot.www.oauth2.GitHubAuth`'s ``getTeamsMembership`` option
  are now added by slug as well as by name. This means a team named "Bot
  Builders" in the organization "buildbot" will be added as both ``buildbot/Bot
  Builders`` and ``buildbot/bot-builders``.
- Make ``urlText`` renderable for the
  :py:class:`~buildbot.steps.transfer.FileUpload` build step.
- Added ``noticeOnChannel`` option to :bb:reporter:`IRC` to send notices
  instead of messages to channels. This was an option in v0.8.x and removed in
  v0.9.0, which defaulted to sending notices. The v0.8.x default of sending
  messages is now restored.

Reverts
-------

- Reverted: Fix git submodule support when using `sshPrivateKey` and `sshHostKey` because it broke other use cases (:issue:`4316`)
  In order to have this feature to work, you need to keep your master in 1.4.0, and make sure your worker ``buildbot.tac`` are installed in the same path as your master.

Buildbot ``1.4.0`` ( ``2018-09-02`` )
=====================================

Bug fixes
---------

- Fix `Build.getUrl()` to not ignore virtual builders.
- Fix git submodule support when using `sshPrivateKey` and `sshHostKey`
  settings by passing ssh data as absolute, not relative paths.
- Fixed :bb:step:`P4` for change in latest version of `p4 login -p`.
- :py:class:`buildbot.reporters.irc.IrcStatusBot` no longer encodes messages
  before passing them on to methods of its Twisted base class to avoid posting
  the ``repr()`` of a bytes object when running on Python 3.

Features
--------

- Added new :bb:step:`GitPush` step to perform git push operations.
- Objects returned by :ref:`renderer` now are able to pass extra arguments to
  the rendered function via `withArgs` method.

Test Suite
----------

- Test suite has been improved for readability by adding a lot of ``inlineCallbacks``
- Fixed tests which didn't wait for ``assertFailure``'s returned deferred.
- The test suite now runs on Python 3.7 (mostly deprecation warnings from dependencies shut down)

Buildbot ``1.3.0`` ( ``2018-07-13`` )
=====================================

Bug fixes
---------

- buildbot-worker docker image no longer use pidfile. This allows to
  auto-restart a docker worker upon crash.
- GitLab v3 API is deprecated and has been removed from http://gitlab.com, so
  we now use v4. (:issue:`4143`)

Features
--------

- -:bb:step:`Git` now supports `sshHostKey` parameter to specify ssh public
  host key for fetch operations.
- -:bb:step:`Git` now supports `sshPrivateKey` parameter to specify private ssh
  key for fetch operations.
- -:bb:chsrc:`GitPoller` now supports `sshHostKey` parameter to specify ssh
  public host key for fetch operations. This feature is supported on git 2.3
  and newer.
- -:bb:chsrc:`GitPoller` now supports `sshPrivateKey` parameter to specify
  private ssh key for fetch operations. This feature is supported on git 2.3
  and newer.
- Github hook token validation now uses ``hmac.compare_digest()`` for better security

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- Removed support for GitLab v3 API ( GitLab < 9 ).

Buildbot ``1.2.0`` ( ``2018-06-10`` )
=====================================

Bug fixes
---------

- Don't schedule a build when a GitLab merge request is deleted or edited (:issue:`3635`)
- Add GitLab source step; using it, we now handle GitLab merge requests from
  forks properly (:issue:`4107`)
- Fixed a bug in :py:class:`~buildbot.reporters.mail.MailNotifier`'s
  ``createEmail`` method when called with the default *builds* value which
  resulted in mail not being sent.
- Fixed a Github crash that happened on Pull Requests, triggered by Github
  Web-hooks. The json sent by the API does not contain a commit message. In
  github.py this causes a crash, resulting into response 500 sent back to
  Github and building failure.
- Speed up generation of api/v2/builders by an order of magnitude. (:issue:`3396`).

Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Added ``examples/gitlab.cfg`` to demonstrate integrating Buildbot with
  GitLab.

Features
--------

- :ref:`ForceScheduler-Parameters` ``ChoiceParameter`` now correctly supports
  the ``strict`` parameter, by allowing free text entry if strict is False.
- Allow the remote ref to be specified in the GitHub hook configuration (:issue:`3998`)
- Added callable to p4 source that allows client code to resolve the p4 user
  and workspace into a more complete author. Default behaviour is a lambda that
  simply returns the original supplied who. This callable happens after the
  existing regex is performed.


Buildbot ``1.1.2`` ( ``2018-05-15`` )
=====================================

Bug fixes
---------

- fix several multimaster issues by reverting :issue:`3911`. re-opens
  :issue:`3783`. (:issue:`4067`, :issue:`4062`, :issue:`4059`)
- Fix :bb:step:`MultipleFileUpload` to correctly compute path name when worker
  and master are on different OS (:issue:`4019`)
- LDAP bytes/unicode handling has been fixed to work with Python 3. This means
  that LDAP authentication, REMOTE_USER authentication, and LDAP avatars now
  work on Python 3. In addition, an of bounds access when trying to load the
  value of an empty LDAP attribute has been fixed.
- Removing ```no-select``` rules from places where they would prevent the user
  from selecting interesting text. (:issue:`3663`)
- fix ```Maximum recursion depth exceeded`` when lots of worker are trying to
  connect while master is starting or reconfiguring (:issue:`4042`).

Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Document a minimal secure config for the Buildbot web interface.
  (:issue:`4026`)

Features
--------

- The Dockerfile for the buildbot master image has been updated to use Alpine
  Linux 3.7. In addition, the Python requests module has been added to this
  image. This makes GitHub authentication work out of the box with this image.
  (:issue:`4039`)
- New steps for Visual Studio 2017 (VS2017, VC141, and MsBuild141).
- The smoke tests have been changed to use ES2017 async and await keywords.
  This requires that the smoke tests run with Node 8 or higher. Use of async
  and await is recommended by the Protractor team:
  https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/async-await.md
- Allow ``urlText`` to be set on a url linked to a ``DirectoryUpload`` step
  (:issue:`3983`)

  Summary page will sort that log first in the list of logs, and automatically
  expand it.


Buildbot ``1.0.0`` ( ``2018-02-11`` )
=====================================

Despite the major version bump, Buildbot 1.0.0 does not have major difference with the 0.9 series.
1.0.0 is rather the mark of API stability.
Developers do not foresee a major API break in the next few years like we had for 0.8 to 0.9.

  when a build starts.
- GitLab reporter now correctly works when there are multiple codebase, and
  when the projects names contain url reserved characters.
- GitLab reporter now correctly reports the status even if there are several
  sourcestamps. Better parsing of change repository in GitLab reporter so that
  it understands ssh urls and https url. GitLab reporter do not use the project
  field anymore to know the repository to push to.

Components Features
-------------------

  Twisted https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/773.
- :ref:`ConsoleView` now display changes the same way as in Recent Changes
  page.
- Fix issue with :ref:`ConsoleView` when no change source is configured but
  still builds have ``got_revision`` property

Components Bug fixes
--------------------

  no longer throws exceptions because the file "is used by another process"
  under Windows

UI Bug fixes
------------

- Fix waterfall scrolling and zooming in current browsers
- ``console_view`` now properly uses ``revlink`` metadata to link to changes.

  events
- :bb:chsrc:`GitLab` now supports authentication
  with the secret token

UI Features
-----------

  transfer steps
- Fix issue with buildbot requesting too many permissions from GitHub's OAuth
- Fix :py:class:`~buildbot.steps.http.HTTPStep` to accept ``json`` as keyword
  argument.
- Updated :py:class:`~buildbot.workers.openstack.OpenStackLatentWorker` to use
  keystoneauth1 so it will support latest python-novaclient packages.
- Include :py:class:`~buildbot.steps.package.rpm.rpmlint.RpmLint` step in steps
  plugins.

Core Features
-------------

- Experimental support for Python 3.5 and 3.6.
  Note that complete support depends on fixes to be released in Twisted 17.2.0.

  access control. If you have access control to your Buildbot, it is
  recommended you add :py:class:`AnyControlEndpointMatcher` at the end of your
  access control configuration.

- Schedulers can now be toggled on and off from the UI. Useful for temporarily
  disabling periodic timers.

Components Features
-------------------

- :py:class:`~buildbot.steps.transfer.FileUpload` now supports setting the url
  title text that is visible in the web UI. :py:class:`~buildbot.steps.transfer.FileUpload` now supports custom `description` and

  default to v2 of the Nova API. The novaclient package has had a deprecation
  warning about v1.1 and would use v2 anyway.

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- ``master/contrib`` and ``worker/contrib`` directories have been moved to
  their own repository at https://github.com/buildbot/buildbot-contrib/

----------------

A database upgrade is necessary for this release (see :bb:cmdline:`upgrade-master`).

Bug fixes
---------

- Like for ``buildbot start``, ``buildbot upgrade-master`` will now erase an old pidfile if the process is not live anymore instead of just failing.

- Workers page improvements:

    - Shows which master the worker is connected to.
    - Shows correctly the list of builders that this master is configured on (not the list of ``buildermaster`` which nobody cares about).
    - Shows list of builds per worker similar to the builders page.
    - New worker details page displays the list of builds built by this worker using database optimized query.

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

  ``wamp_debug_level`` option instead.
- fix issue with factory.workdir AttributeError are not properly reported.

Features
--------

- Optimize the memory consumption of the log compression process. Buildbot do
  not load the whole log into memory anymore. This should improve a lot
  buildbot memory footprint.

  is a preview means the last lines of log. How many lines is configurable per
  user in the user settings page.
- Log viewer line numbers are no longer selectable, so that it is easier to
  copy paste.
