Release Notes for Buildbot |version|
====================================

..
    Any change that adds a feature or fixes a bug should have an entry here.
    Most simply need an additional bulleted list item, but more significant
    changes can be given a subsection of their own.

..
    NOTE: When releasing 0.9.0, combine these notes with those from 0.9.0b{1,2}
    into one single set of notes.  Also, link prominently to the migration guide.

The following are the release notes for Buildbot |version|

See :ref:`Upgrading to Nine` for a guide to upgrading from 0.8.x to 0.9.x

Master
------

Features
~~~~~~~~
* ``hello`` now returns 'Hello' in a random language if invoked more than once.

* :bb:sched:`Triggerable` now accepts a ``reason`` parameter.

* :bb:reporter:`GerritStatusPush` now accepts a ``builders`` parameter.

Fixes
~~~~~

* The :bb:step:`PyFlakes` and :bb:step:`PyLint` steps no longer parse output in Buildbot log headers (:bug:`3337`).

* :bb:chsrc:`GerritChangeSource` is now less verbose by default, and has a ``debug`` option to enable the logs.

* :bb:chsrc:`P4Source` no longer relies on the perforce server time to poll for new changes.

* The commit message for a change from :bb:chsrc:`P4Source` now matches what the user typed in.

Slave
-----

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Buildbot now supports wamp as a mq backend.
  This allows to run a multi-master configuration.
  See :ref:`MQ-Specification`.

* The Buildbot slave now includes the number of CPUs in the information it supplies to the master on connection.
  This value is autodetected, but can be overridden with the ``--numcpus`` argument to ``buildslave create-slave``.
