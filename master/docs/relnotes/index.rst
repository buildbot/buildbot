========================================

..
    Any change that adds a feature or fixes a bug should have an entry here.

    changes can be given a subsection of their own.

    If you can:

       please point to the bug using syntax: (:bug:`NNN`)
       please point to classes using syntax: :py:class:`~buildbot.reporters.http.HttpStatusBase`

    NOTE: When releasing 0.9.0, combine these notes with those from 0.9.0b*
