Buildbot ``3.9.2`` ( ``2023-09-02`` )
=====================================

Bug fixes
---------

- Work around requirements parsing error for the Twisted dependency by pinning Twisted to 22.10 or older.
  This fixes buildbot crash on startup when newest Twisted is installed.


Buildbot ``3.9.1`` ( ``2023-09-02`` )
=====================================

Bug fixes
---------

- Fixed handling of primary key columns on Postgres in the ``copy-db`` script.
- Fixed a race condition in the ``copy-db`` script which sometimes lead to no data being copied.
- Options for `create-worker` that are converted to numbers are now also checked to be valid Python literals.
  This will prevent creating invalid worker configurations, e.g.: when using option ``--umask=022`` instead of ``--umask=0o022`` or ``--umask=18``. (:issue:`7047`)
- Fixed worker not connecting error when there are files in WORKER/info folder that can not be decoded. (:issue:`3585`) (:issue:`4758`) (:issue:`6932`)
- Fixed incorrect git command line parameters when using ``Git`` source step with ``mode="incremental"``, ``shallow=True``, ``submodules=True`` (regression since Buildbot 3.9.0) (:issue:`7054`).

Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Clarified that ``shallow`` option for the ``Git`` source step is also supported in ``incremental`` mode.


Buildbot ``3.9.0`` ( ``2023-08-16`` )
=====================================

Bug fixes
---------

- Fixed missed invocations of methods decorated with ``util.debounce`` when debouncer was being stopped under certain conditions.
  This caused step and build state string updates to be sometimes missed.
- Improved stale connection handling in ``GerritChangeSource``.
  ``GerritChangeSource`` will instruct the ssh client to send periodic keepalive messages and will reconnect if the server does not reply for 45 seconds (default).
  ``GerritChangeSource`` now has ``ssh_server_alive_interval_s`` and ``ssh_server_alive_count_max`` options to control this behavior.
- Fixed unnecessary build started under the following conditions: there is an existing Nightly scheduler, ``onlyIfChanged`` is set to true and there is version upgrade from v3.4.0 (:issue:`6793`).
- Fixed performance of changes data API queries with custom filters.
- Prevent possible event loss during reconfig of reporters (:issue:`6982`).
- Fixed exception thrown when worker copies directories in Solaris operating system (:issue:`6870`).
- Fixed excessive log messages due to JWT token decoding error (:issue:`6872`).
- Fixed excessive log messages when otherwise unsupported ``/auth/login`` endpoint is accessed when using ``RemoteUserAuth`` authentication plugin.

Features
--------

- Introduce a way to group builders by project.
  A new ``projects`` list is added to the configuration dictionary.
  Builders can be associated to the entries in that list by the new ``project`` argument.

  Grouping builders by project allows to significantly clean up the UI in larger Buildbot installations that contain hundreds or thousands of builders for a smaller number of unrelated codebases.
  This is currently implemented only in experimental React UI.
- Added support specifying the project in ``GitHubPullrequestPoller``.
  Previously it was forced to be equal to GitHub's repository full name.
- Reporter ``BitbucketServerCoreAPIStatusPush`` now supports ``BuildRequestGenerator`` and generates build status for build requests (by default).
- Buildbot now has ``copy-db`` script migrate all data stored in the database from one database to another.
  This may be used to change database engine types.
  For example a sqlite database may be migrated to Postgres or MySQL when the load and data size grows.
- Added cron features like last day of month to ``Nightly`` Scheduler.
- Buildrequests can now have their priority changed, using the ``/buildrequests`` API.
- The force scheduler can now set a build request priority.
- Added support for specifying builder descriptions in markdown which is later rendered to HTML for presentation in the web frontend.
- Build requests are now sorted according to their buildrequest.
  Request time is now used as a secondary sort key.
- Significantly improved performance of reporters or reporters with slower generators which is important on larger Buildbot installations.
- Schedulers can now set a default priority for the buildrequests that it creates.
  It can either be an integer or a function.
- Implement support for shallow submodule update using git.
- ``GerritChangeSource`` will now log a small number of previous log lines coming from ``ssh`` process in case of connection failure.

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- Deprecated ``projectName`` and ``projectURL`` configuration dictionary keys.


Buildbot ``3.8.0`` ( ``2023-04-16`` )
=====================================

Bug fixes
---------

- Fixed compatibility issues with Python 3.11.
- Fixed compatibility with Autobahn v22.4.1 and newer.
- Fixed issue with overriding `env` when calling `ShellMixin.makeRemoteShellCommand`
- Buildbot will now include the previous location of moved files when evaluating a Github commit.
  This fixes an issue where a commit that moves a file out of a folder, would not be shown in the
  web UI for a builder that is tracking that same folder.
- Improved reliability of Buildbot log watching to follow log files even after rotation.
  This improves reliability of Buildbot start and restart scripts.
- Fixed handling of occasional errors that happen when attempting to kill a master-side process that has already exited.
- Fixed a race condition in PyLint step that may lead to step throwing exceptions.
- Fixed compatibility with qemu 6.1 and newer when using LibVirtWorker with ``cheap_copy=True`` (default).
- Fixed an issue with secrets provider stripping newline from ssh keys sent in git steps.
- Fixed occasional errors that happen when killing processes on Windows. TASKKILL command may return
  code 255 when process has already exited.
- Fixed deleting secrets from worker that contain '~' in their destination path.

Changes
-------

- Buildbot now requires NodeJS 14.18 or newer to build the frontend.
- The URLs emitted by the Buildbot APIs have been changed to include slash after the hash (``#``)
  symbol to be compatible with what React web UI supports.

Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Replace statement "https is unsupported" with a more detailed disclaimer.

Features
--------

- Add a way to disable default ``WarningCountingShellCommand`` parser.
- Added health check API that latent workers can use to specify that a particular worker will not connect and build should not wait for it and mark itself as failure immediately.

Buildbot ``3.7.0`` ( ``2022-12-04`` )
=====================================

Bug fixes
---------

- Improved statistics capture to avoid negative build duration.
- Improved reliability of "buildbot stop" (:issue:`3535`).
- Cancelled builds now have stop reason included into the state string.
- Fixed ``custom_class`` change hook checks to allow hook without a plugin.
- Added treq response wrapper to fix issue with missing url attribute.
- Fixed Buildbot Worker being unable to start on Python 2.7 due to issue in a new version of Automat dependency.

Features
--------

- Expanded ``ChangeFilter`` filtering capabilities:
   - New ``<attribute>_not_eq`` parameters to require no match
   - ``<attribute>_re`` now support multiple regexes
   - New ``<attribute>_not_re`` parameters to require no match by regex
   - New ``property_<match_type>`` parameters to perform filtering on change properties.
- Exposed frontend configuration as implementation-defined JSON document that can be queried separately.
- Added support for custom branch keys to ``OldBuildCanceller``.
  This is useful in Version Control Systems such as Gerrit that have multiple branch names for the same logical branch that should be tracked by the canceller.
- ``p4port`` argument of the ``P4`` step has been marked renderable.
- Added automatic generation of commands for Telegram bot without need to send them manually to BotFather.

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- This release includes an experimental web UI written using React framework.
  The existing web UI is written using AngularJS framework which is no longer maintained.
  The new web UI can be tested by installing ``buildbot-www-react`` package and ``'base_react': {}`` key-value to www plugins.
  Currently no web UI plugins are supported.
  The existing web UI will be deprecated on subsequent Buildbot released and eventually replaced with the React-based web UI on Buildbot 4.0.

Buildbot ``3.5.0`` ( ``2022-03-06`` )
=====================================

Bug fixes
---------

- Improved handling of "The container operating system does not match the host operating system" error on Docker on Windows to mark the build as erroneous so that it's not retried.
- Fixed rare ``AlreadyCalledError`` exceptions in the logs when worker worker connection is lost at the same time it is delivering final outcome of a command.
- Fixed errors when accessing non-existing build via REST API when an endpoint matching rule with builder filter was present.
- Fixed an error in ``CMake`` passing options and definitions on the cmake command line.
- Fixed an error when handling command management errors on the worker side (regression since v3.0.0).
- Fixed updating build step summary with mock state changes for MockBuildSRPM and MockRebuild.
- Fixed support for optional ``builder`` parameter used in RebuildBuildEndpointMatcher (:issue:`6307`).

=====================================

Bug fixes
---------

- Fixed support of SQLAlchemy v1.4 (:issue:`5992`).
- Improved default build request collapsing functionality to take into account properties set by the scheduler and not collapse build requests if they differ (:issue:`4686`).
- Fixed a race condition that would result in attempts to complete unclaimed buildrequests (:issue:`3762`).

Buildbot ``3.2.0`` ( ``2021-06-17`` )
=====================================

Bug fixes
---------

- Fixed occasional ``InvalidSpotInstanceRequestID.NotFound`` errors when using spot instances on EC2.
  This could have lead to Buildbot launching zombie instances and not shutting them down.
- Improved ``GitPoller`` behavior during reconfiguration to exit at earliest possible opportunity and thus reduce the delay that running ``GitPoller`` incurs for the reconfiguration.
- The docker container for the master now fully builds the www packages.
  Previously they were downloaded from pypi which resulted in downloading whatever version was newest at the time (:issue:`4998`).
- Implemented time out for master-side utility processes (e.g. ``git`` or ``hg``) which could break the respective version control poller potentially indefinitely upon hanging.
- Fixed a regression in the ``reconfig`` script which would time out instead of printing error when configuration update was not successfully applied.
- Improved buildbot restart behavior to restore the worker paused state (:issue:`6074`)

----------------------

- Added documentation about installation Buildbot worker as Windows service.

Features
--------

- ``DebPbuilder`` now supports the ``--othermirror`` flag for including additional repositories
- Implemented support for setting docker container's hostname
- The libvirt latent worker will now wait for the VM to come online instead of disabling the worker during connection establishment process.

- Buildbot now sends metadata required to establish connection back to master to libvirt worker VMs.
- ``LibVirtWorker`` will now setup libvirt metadata with details needed by the worker to connect back to master.
- The docker container for the master has been switched to Debian.
  Additionally, buildbot is installed into a virtualenv there to reduce chances of conflicts with Python packages installed via ``dpkg``.
- BitbucketStatusPush now has renderable build status key, name, and description.
- Pausing a worker is a manual operation which the quarantine timer was overwriting. Worker paused state and quarantine state are now independent. (:issue:`5611`)
- Reduce buildbot_worker wheel package size by 40% by dropping tests from package.

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- The `connection` argument of the LibVirtWorker constructor has been deprecated along with the related `Connection` class.
  Use `uri` as replacement.
- The ``*NewStyle`` build step aliases have been removed.
  Please use equivalent steps without the ``NewStyle`` suffix in the name.
- Try client no longer supports protocol used by Buildbot older than v0.9.

---------

- Fixed usage of invalid characters in temporary file names by git-related steps (:issue:`5949`)
- Fixed parsing of URLs of the form https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/OWNER/REPONAME in BitbucketStatusPush.
  These URLs are in the sourcestamps returned by the Bitbucket Cloud hook.
- Brought back the old (pre v2.9.0) behavior of the ``FileDownload`` step to act
  more gracefully by returning ``FAILURE`` instead of raising an exception when the file doesn't exist
  on master. This makes use cases such as ``FileDownload(haltOnFailure=False)`` possible again.
- Fixed issue with ``getNewestCompleteTime`` which was returning no completed builds, although it could.
- Fixed the ``Git`` source step causing last active branch to point to wrong commits.
  This only affected the branch state in the local repository, the checked out code was correct.
- Improved cleanup of any containers left running by ``OpenstackLatentWorker``.
- Improved consistency of log messages produced by the reconfig script.
  Note that this output is not part of public API of Buildbot and may change at any time.
- Improved error message when try client cannot create a build due to builder being not configured on master side.
- Fixed exception when submitting builds via try jobdir client when the branch was not explicitly specified.
- Fixed handling of secrets in nested folders by the vault provider.

Features
--------

- Implemented report generator for new build requests
- Allow usage of Basic authentication to access GitHub API when looking for avatars
- Added support for default Pylint message that was changed in v2.0.

- Implemented ``GitDiffInfo`` step that would extract information about what code has been changed in a pull/merge request.
- Add support ``--submodule`` option for the ``repo init`` command of the Repo source step.

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- ``MessageFormatter`` will receive the actual builder name instead of ``whole buildset`` when used from ``BuildSetStatusGenerator``.


Buildbot ``3.0.3`` ( ``2021-04-05`` )

- Fixed missing data in Owners and Worker columns in changes and workers pages (:issue:`5888`, :issue:`5887`).
- Fixed excessive debug logging in ``GerritEventLogPoller``.
- Fixed regression in pending buildrequests UI where owner is not displayed anymore (:issue:`5940`).
- Re-added support for ``lazylogfiles`` argument of ``ShellCommand`` that was available in old style steps.
