==================================

..
    Any change that adds a feature or fixes a bug should have an entry here.
    Most simply need an additional bulleted list item, but more significant
    changes can be given a subsection of their own.

The following are the release notes for Buildbot 0.9.0b2.
Buildbot 0.9.0b2 was released on August, 2 2015.

Master
------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Mercurial hook was updated and modernized.
  It is no longer necessary to fork.
  One can now extend PYTHONPATH via the hook configuration.
  Among others, it permits to use a buildbot virtualenv instead of installing buildbot in all the system.
  Added documentation inside the hook.
  Misc. clean-up and reorganization in order to make the code a bit more readable.


* UI templates can now be customizable.
  You can provide html or jade overrides to the www plugins, to customize the UI

* UI side bar is now fixed by default for large screens.

Fixes
~~~~~

* Fix setup for missing www.hooks module

* Fix setup to install only on recents version of pip (>=1.4).
  This prevents unexpected upgrade to nine from people who just use ``pip install -U buildbot``

Changes for Developers

  **For retro-compatibility, all callable taking only 2 parameters will still work**.
