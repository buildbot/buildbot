Buildbot 0.3.4 was released 28 Jul 2003

** IRC client

The buildmaster can now join a set of IRC channels and respond to simple
queries about builder status.

** worker information

The build workers can now report information from a set of info/* files in
the worker base directory to the buildmaster. This will be used by the worker
administrator to announce details about the system hosting the worker,
contact information, etc. For now, info/admin should contain the name/email
of the person who is responsible for the buildworker, and info/host should
describe the system hosting the build worker (OS version, CPU speed, memory,
etc). The contents of these files are made available through the waterfall
display.

** change notification email parsers

A parser for Syncmail (syncmail.sourceforge.net) was added. SourceForge
provides examples of setting up syncmail to deliver CVS commit messages to
mailing lists, so hopefully this will make it easier for sourceforge-hosted
projects to set up a buildbot.

email processors were moved into buildbot.changes.mail . FCMaildirSource was
moved, and the compatibility location (buildbot.changes.freshcvsmail) will
go away in the next release.

** w32 buildworker ought to work

Some non-portable code was changed to make it more likely that the
buildworker will run under windows. The Twisted buildbot now has a
(more-or-less) working w32 buildworker.
