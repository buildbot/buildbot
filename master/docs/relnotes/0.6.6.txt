Buildbot 0.6.6 was released 23 May 2005

** bugs fixed

The 'sendchange', 'stop', and 'sighup' subcommands were broken, simple bugs
that were not caught by the test suite. Sorry.

The 'buildbot master' command now uses "raw" strings to create .tac files
that will still function under windows (since we must put directory names
that contain backslashes into that file).

The keep-on-disk behavior added in 0.6.5 included the ability to upgrade old
in-pickle LogFile instances. This upgrade function was not added to the
HTMLLogFile class, so an exception would be raised when attempting to load or
display any build with one of these logs (which are normally used only for
showing build exceptions). This has been fixed.

Several unnecessary imports were removed, so the Buildbot should function
normally with just Twisted-2.0.0's "Core" module installed. (of course you
will need TwistedWeb, TwistedWords, and/or TwistedMail if you use status
targets that require them). The test suite should skip all tests that cannot
be run because of missing Twisted modules.

The master/slave's basedir is now prepended to sys.path before starting the
daemon. This used to happen implicitly (as a result of twistd's setup
preamble), but 0.6.5 internalized the invocation of twistd and did not copy
this behavior. This change restores the ability to access "private.py"-style
modules in the basedir from the master.cfg file with a simple "import
private" statement. Thanks to Thomas Vander Stichele for the catch.
