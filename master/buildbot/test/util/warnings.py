# Utility functions for catching Python warnings.
# Twisted's TestCase already gathers produced warnings
# (see t.t.u.T.flushWarnings()), however Twisted's implementation doesn't
# allow fine-grained control over caught warnings.
# This implementation uses context wrapper style to specify interesting
# block of code to catch warnings, which allows to easily specify which
# exactly statements should generate warnings and which shouldn't.
# Also this implementation allows nested checks.
