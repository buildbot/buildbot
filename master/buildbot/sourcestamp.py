    """This is a tuple of (branch, revision, patchspec, changes, project, repository).

    C{branch} is always valid, although it may be None to let the Source
    step use its default branch. There are three possibilities for the
    remaining elements:
     - (revision=REV, patchspec=None, changes=None): build REV. If REV is
       None, build the HEAD revision from the given branch. Note that REV
       must always be a string: SVN, Perforce, and other systems which use
       integers should provide a string here, but the Source checkout step
       will integerize it when making comparisons.
     - (revision=REV, patchspec=(LEVEL, DIFF), changes=None): checkout REV,
       then apply a patch to the source, with C{patch -pPATCHLEVEL <DIFF}.
       If REV is None, checkout HEAD and patch it.
     - (revision=None, patchspec=None, changes=[CHANGES]): let the Source
       step check out the latest revision indicated by the given Changes.
       CHANGES is a tuple of L{buildbot.changes.changes.Change} instances,
       and all must be on the same branch.
