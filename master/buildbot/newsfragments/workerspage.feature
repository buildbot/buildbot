Workers page improvement:
Shows which master the worker is connected to.
Shows correctly the list of builders that this master is configured on (not the list of ``buildermaster`` which nobody cares about).
Shows list of builds per worker similar to the builders page.
New worker details page displays the list of builds built by this worker using database optimized query.
