        WARNING: You are running Buildbot with Python 2.7.x !
        -----------------------------------------------------

        Python 2 is going unmaintained as soon as 2020: https://pythonclock.org/

        To prepare for that transition, we recommend upgrading your buildmaster to run on
        Python 3.6 now! Buildbot open source project is as well deprecating running buildmaster
        on Python 2 for better maintainability.

        Buildbot 2.0 going to be released in February 2019 will remove support for Python < 3.5
        https://github.com/buildbot/buildbot/issues/4439

        On most installations, switching to Python 3 can be accomplished by running the 2to3 tool
        over the master.cfg file.

        https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/2to3.html

        Note that the above applies only for the buildmaster.
        Workers will still support running under Python 2.7.
        Additionally, the buildmaster still supports workers using old versions of Buildbot.
