            @lockid: a locks.MasterLock or locks.WorkerLock instance
            @config_version: The version of the config from which the list of locks has been
                acquired by the downstream user.
            @return: a locks.RealMasterLock or locks.RealWorkerLock instance

            The real locks are tracked using lock ID and config_version. The latter is used as a
            way to track most recent properties of real locks.

            This approach is needed because there's no central registry of lock access instances
            that are used within a Buildbot master.cfg (like there is for e.g c['builders']). All
            lock accesses bring all lock information with themselves as the lockid member.
            Therefore, the reconfig process is relatively complicated, because we don't know
            whether a specific access instance encodes lock information before reconfig or after.
            Taking into account config_version allows us to know when properties of a lock should
            be updated.

            Note that the user may create multiple lock ids with different maxCount values. It's
            unspecified which maxCount value the real lock will have.
