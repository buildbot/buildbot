    A rolled-up encapsulation of all of the data relevant to a build request.

    This class is used by the C{nextBuild} and C{mergeRequests} configuration
    parameters, as well as in starting a build.  Construction of a BuildRequest
    object is a heavyweight process involving a lot of database queries, so
    it should be avoided where possible.  See bug #1894.

    @type reason: string
    @ivar reason: the reason this Build is being requested. Schedulers provide
    this, but for forced builds the user requesting the build will provide a
    string.  It comes from the buildsets table.

    @type properties: L{properties.Properties}
    @ivar properties: properties that should be applied to this build, taken
    from the buildset containing this build request

    @ivar submittedAt: a timestamp (seconds since epoch) when this request was
    submitted to the Builder. This is used by the CVS step to compute a
    checkout timestamp, as well as by the master to prioritize build requests
    from oldest to newest.

    @ivar buildername: name of the requested builder
