class BuildRequest(object):
    """

    A rolled-up encapsulation of all of the data relevant to a build request.

    This class is used by the C{nextBuild} and C{mergeRequests} configuration
    parameters, as well as in starting a build.  Construction of a BuildRequest
    object is a heavyweight process involving a lot of database queries, so
    it should be avoided where possible.  See bug #1894.

    Build requests have a SourceStamp which specifies what sources to build.
    This may specify a specific revision of the source tree (so source.branch,
    source.revision, and source.patch are used). The .patch attribute is either
    None or a tuple of (patchlevel, diff), consisting of a number to use in
    'patch -pN', and a unified-format context diff.

    Alternatively, the SourceStamp may specify a set of Changes to be built,
    contained in source.changes. In this case, the requeset may be mergeable
    with other BuildRequests on the same branch.

    @type source: L{buildbot.sourcestamp.SourceStamp}
    @ivar source: the source stamp that this BuildRequest use

    @type reason: string
    @ivar reason: the reason this Build is being requested. Schedulers provide
    this, but for forced builds the user requesting the build will provide a
    string.  It comes from the buildsets table.

    @type properties: L{properties.Properties}
    @ivar properties: properties that should be applied to this build, taken
    from the buildset containing this build request

    @ivar submittedAt: a timestamp (seconds since epoch) when this request was
    submitted to the Builder. This is used by the CVS step to compute a
    checkout timestamp, as well as by the master to prioritize build requests
    from oldest to newest.

    @ivar buildername: name of the requested builder

    @ivar priority: request priority

    @ivar id: build request ID

    @ivar bsid: ID of the parent buildset
