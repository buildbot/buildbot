class Builder(pb.Referenceable, service.MultiService):
    """I manage all Builds of a given type.

    Each Builder is created by an entry in the config file (the c['builders']
    list), with a number of parameters.

    One of these parameters is the L{buildbot.process.factory.BuildFactory}
    object that is associated with this Builder. The factory is responsible
    for creating new L{Build<buildbot.process.build.Build>} objects. Each
    Build object defines when and how the build is performed, so a new
    Factory or Builder should be defined to control this behavior.

    The Builder holds on to a number of L{BuildRequest} objects in a
    list named C{.buildable}. Incoming BuildRequest objects will be added to
    this list, or (if possible) merged into an existing request. When a slave
    becomes available, I will use my C{BuildFactory} to turn the request into
    a new C{Build} object. The C{BuildRequest} is forgotten, the C{Build}
    goes into C{.building} while it runs. Once the build finishes, I will
    discard it.

    I maintain a list of available SlaveBuilders, one for each connected
    slave that the C{slavenames} parameter says we can use. Some of these
    will be idle, some of them will be busy running builds for me. If there
    are multiple slaves, I can run multiple builds at once.

    I also manage forced builds, progress expectation (ETA) management, and
    some status delivery chores.
