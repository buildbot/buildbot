displayName: Test result
description: |
    This resource represents a test result.
    Test results that are produced by a single test run are grouped by a relation to a test result set.
    Single test result set may represent thousands of test results.

    Update Methods
    --------------

    All update methods are available as attributes of ``master.data.updates``.

    .. py:class:: buildbot.data.test_result_sets.TestResult

        .. py:method:: addTestResults(builderid, test_result_setid, result_values)

            :param integer builderid: The ID of the builder corresponding to the test result set.
            :param integer test_result_setid: The ID of the test result set for which to add results.
            :param integer result_values: A list of dictionaries that define the test results.

            Creates one or more new test results.
            This is a batch-based method as large number of test results are usually associated to a
            single test result set.

            The dictionaries in ``result_value`` may have the following keys:

             - ``value`` (required): A string containing the value of the test result.

             - ``test_name`` (optional): A string containing the name of the test that.

             - ``test_code_path`` (optional): A string containing the path of the test.

             - ``line`` (optional): An integer containing the line within the source file
                corresponding to the test.

             - ``duration_ns`` (optional): An integer defining the duration of the test in
                nanoseconds.

            At least one of ``test_name``, ``test_code_path`` must be specified.

            The function returns nothing.
