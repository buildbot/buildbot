displayName: Test result
description: |
    This resource represents a test result.
    Test results that are produced by a single test run are grouped by a relation to a test result set.
    Single test result set may represent thousands of test results.

    TODO: It may make sense to add an option to return the test names in one go. Otherwise we would
    need to make a join on the client side which may not be optimal in case of thousands of test
    results.
