    A worker resource represents a worker to the source code monitored by Buildbot.

    The contents of the ``connected_to`` and ``configured_on`` attributes are sensitive to the context of the request.
    If a builder or master is specified in the path, then only the corresponding connections and configurations are included in the result.

            The worker information can be any JSON-able object.

            * ``host`` (the name of the host)
            * ``access_uri`` (the access URI)
            * ``version`` (the version on the worker)
