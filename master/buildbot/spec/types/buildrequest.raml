    This resource type describes completed and in-progress buildrequests.
    Much of the contextual data for a buildrequest is associated with the buildset that contains this buildrequest.


    Update Methods
    --------------

    All update methods are available as attributes of ``master.data.updates``.

        type: integer
    claimed:
        description: |
            True if this buildrequest has been claimed.
            Note that this is a calculated field (from claimed_at != None).
            Ordering by this field is not optimized by the database layer.
        type: boolean
    claimed_at?:
        description: |
            time at which this build has last been claimed.
            None if this buildrequest has never been claimed or has been unclaimed
        type: date
    claimed_by_masterid?:
        description:  |
            the id of the master that claimed this buildrequest.
            None if this buildrequest has never been claimed or has been unclaimed
        type: integer
    complete:
        description: true if this buildrequest is complete
        type: boolean
    complete_at?:
        description: |
            time at which this buildrequest was completed, or None if it's still running
        type: date
    priority:
        description: the priority of this buildrequest
        type: integer
    results?:
        description: |
            the results of this buildrequest (see :ref:`Build-Result-Codes`), or None if not complete

        type: date
    waited_for:
        description: |
            True if the entity that triggered this buildrequest is waiting for it to complete.
            Should be used by an (unimplemented so far) clean shutdown to only start br that are waited_for.
