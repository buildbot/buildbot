displayName: Test result set
description: |
    This resource represents a test result set.
    A test result set consists of a number of related test results.
    These test results need to be related in that they represent the same type of data and are produced by a single step.
    In reasonably tested codebases the number of test results in a test result set will approach several or even tens of thousands.

    There may be a long delay between the creation of the test result set and full creation of the corresponding test results.
    This is tracked by the ``parsed`` property.
    If it's ``true``, then the full set of test results have been committed to the database.

    The ``test_result_unparsed_set`` object tracks test result sets that have not been parsed yet.
