                                            This endpoint does not provide paging capabilities.
                                            For stream log types, the type line header characters are dropped.
                                            'text/plain' is used as the mime type except for html logs, where 'text/html' is used.
                                            The 'slug' is used as the filename for the resulting download. Some browsers are appending ``".txt"`` or ``".html"`` to this filename according to the mime-type.
