class LogFileProducer:

    """What's the plan?

    the LogFile has just one FD, used for both reading and writing.
    Each time you add an entry, fd.seek to the end and then write.

    Each reader (i.e. Producer) keeps track of their own offset. The reader
    starts by seeking to the start of the logfile, and reading forwards.
    Between each hunk of file they yield chunks, so they must remember their
    offset before yielding and re-seek back to that offset before reading
    more data. When their read() returns EOF, they're finished with the first
    phase of the reading (everything that's already been written to disk).

    After EOF, the remaining data is entirely in the current entries list.
    These entries are all of the same channel, so we can do one "".join and
    obtain a single chunk to be sent to the listener. But since that involves
    a yield, and more data might arrive after we give up control, we have to
    subscribe them before yielding. We can't subscribe them any earlier,
    otherwise they'd get data out of order.

    We're using a generator in the first place so that the listener can
    throttle us, which means they're pulling. But the subscription means
    we're pushing. Really we're a Producer. In the first phase we can be
    either a PullProducer or a PushProducer. In the second phase we're only a
    PushProducer.

    So the client gives a LogFileConsumer to File.subscribeConsumer . This
    Consumer must have registerProducer(), unregisterProducer(), and
    writeChunk(), and is just like a regular twisted.interfaces.IConsumer,
    except that writeChunk() takes chunks (tuples of (channel,text)) instead
    of the normal write() which takes just text. The LogFileConsumer is
    allowed to call stopProducing, pauseProducing, and resumeProducing on the
    producer instance it is given. """
