        @type  fromaddr: string
        @param fromaddr: the email address to be used in the 'From' header.

        @type  tree: string
        @param tree: The Tinderbox tree to post to.
                     When tree is a WithProperties instance it will be
                     interpolated as such. See WithProperties for more detail

        @type  extraRecipients: tuple of string
        @param extraRecipients: E-mail addresses of recipients. This should at
                                least include the tinderbox daemon.

        @type  categories: list of strings
        @param categories: a list of category names to serve status
                           information for. Defaults to None (all
                           categories). Use either builders or categories,
                           but not both.

        @param builders: a list of builder names for which mail should be
                         sent. Defaults to None (send mail for all builds).
                         Use either builders or categories, but not both.

        @type  relayhost: string
        @param relayhost: the host to which the outbound SMTP connection
                          should be made. Defaults to 'localhost'

        @type  subject: string
        @param subject: a string to be used as the subject line of the message.
                        %(builder)s will be replaced with the name of the
                        %builder which provoked the message.
                        This parameter is not significant for the tinderbox
                        daemon.

        @type  binaryURL: string
        @param binaryURL: If specified, this should be the location where final
                          binary for a build is located.
                          (ie. http://www.myproject.org/nightly/08-08-2006.tgz)
                          It will be posted to the Tinderbox.

        @type  logCompression: string
        @param logCompression: The type of compression to use on the log.
                               Valid options are"bzip2" and "gzip". gzip is
                               only known to work on Python 2.4 and above.

        @type  errorparser: string
        @param errorparser: The error parser that the Tinderbox server
                            should use when scanning the log file.
                            Default is "unix".

        @type  columnName: string
        @param columnName: When columnName is None, use the buildername as
                           the Tinderbox column name. When columnName is a
                           string this exact string will be used for all
                           builders that this TinderboxMailNotifier cares
                           about (not recommended). When columnName is a
                           WithProperties instance it will be interpolated
                           as such. See WithProperties for more detail.

        @param useChangeTime: When True, the time of the first Change for a
