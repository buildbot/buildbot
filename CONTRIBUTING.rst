Review

Buildbot's code-review process is described at http://trac.buildbot.net/wiki/PatchReview.
The important point to know is that Buildbot requires a positive review (adding the "merge-me" label) before a change is eligible to be merged.

Development Tips
----------------

The easiest way to hack on Buildbot is in a ``virtualenv``.
See http://docs.buildbot.net/latest/developer/tests.html#quick-start for a description of how to set up such a thing, and how to run the test suite.
