# JS build strategy:
#
# Obviously, building javascript with setuptools is not really something supported initially
#
# The goal of this hack are:
# - override the distutils command to insert our js build
# - has very small setup.py
#
# from buildbot_pkg import setup_www
#
# setup_www(
#   ...
#    packages=["buildbot_myplugin"]
# )
#
# We need to override the first command done, so that source tree is populated very soon,
# as well as version is found from git tree or "VERSION" file
#
# This supports following setup.py commands:
#
# - develop, via egg_info
# - install, via egg_info
# - sdist, via egg_info
# - bdist_wheel, via build
# This is why we override both egg_info and build, and the first run build the js.
