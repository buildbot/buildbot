[MASTER]

# Specify a configuration file.

# Python code to execute, usually for sys.path manipulation such as
# pygtk.require().
#init-hook=

# Profiled execution.

[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Enable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You can
# either give multiple identifier separated by comma (,) or put this option
# multiple time.

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifier separated by comma (,) or put this option

# C0103: Invalid name "xxx" (should match [a-z_][a-z0-9_]{2,30}$)
# C0111: Missing docstring
# C0301: Line too long (NN/80)
# C0302: Too many lines in module (%s) Used when a module has too much lines,
# reducing its readibility.
# I0011: Locally disabling %s Used when an inline option disable a message or a
# messages category.
# R0201: Method could be a function. Used when a method doesn't use its bound
# instance, and so could be written as a function.
# R0801: Similar lines in %s files. Indicates that a set of similar lines has
# been detected among multiple file. This usually means that the code should be
# refactored to avoid this duplication.
# R0902: Too many instance attributes (N/7)
# R0903: Too few public methods (N/2)
# R0904: Too many public methods (N/20)
# R0911: Too many return statements (N/6)
# R0912: Too many branches (N/12)
# R0913: Too many arguments (N/5)
# R0914: Too many local variables (N/15)
# R0915: Too many statements (N/50)
# W0102: Dangerous default value %s as argument Used when a mutable value as
# list or dictionary  is detected in a default value for an argument.
# W0141: Used builtin function 'N'
# W0142: Used * or * magic* Used when a function or method is called using *args
# or **kwargs to dispatch arguments. This doesn't improve readility and should
# be used with care.
# W0212: Access to a protected member %s of a client class Used when a protected
# member  (i.e. class member with a name beginning with an underscore) is access
# outside the class or a descendant of the class where it's defined.
# W0232: Class has no __init__ method Used when a class has no __init__ method,
# neither its parent classes.
# W0511: TODO
# W0602: Using global for %r but no assigment is done Used when a variable is
# defined through  the "global" statement but no assigment to this variable is
# done.
# W0603: Using the global statement Used when you use the "global" statement to
# update a global variable.
# W0613: Unused argument ''
# W0622: Redefining built-in %r Used when a variable or function override a
# built-in.
# W0704: Except doesn't do anything Used when an except clause does nothing but
# "pass" and there is no "else" clause.
