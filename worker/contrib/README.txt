Utility scripts, things contributed by users but not strictly a part of
buildbot:

zsh/_buildbot-worker: zsh tab-completion file for 'buildbot-worker' command.
                      Put it in one of the directories appearing in $fpath 
                      to enable tab-completion in zsh.

bash/buildbot-worker: bash tab-completion file for 'buildbot-worker' command.
                      Source this file to enable completions in your bash 
                      session. This is typically accomplished by placing the 
                      file into the appropriate 'bash_completion.d' directory.
