# version history:
#  >=1.17: commands are interruptable
#  >=1.28: Arch understands 'revision', added Bazaar
#  >=1.33: Source classes understand 'retry'
#  >=1.39: Source classes correctly handle changes in branch (except Git)
#          Darcs accepts 'revision' (now all do but Git) (well, and P4Sync)
#          Arch/Baz should accept 'build-config'
#  >=1.51: (release 0.7.3)
#  >= 2.1: SlaveShellCommand now accepts 'initial_stdin', 'keep_stdin_open',
#          and 'logfiles'. It now sends 'log' messages in addition to
#          stdout/stdin/header/rc. It acquired writeStdin/closeStdin methods,
#          but these are not remotely callable yet.
#          (not externally visible: ShellCommandPP has writeStdin/closeStdin.
#          ShellCommand accepts new arguments (logfiles=, initialStdin=,
#          keepStdinOpen=) and no longer accepts stdin=)
#          (release 0.7.4)
#  >= 2.2: added monotone, uploadFile, and downloadFile (release 0.7.5)
#  >= 2.3: added bzr (release 0.7.6)
#  >= 2.4: Git understands 'revision' and branches
#  >= 2.5: workaround added for remote 'hg clone --rev REV' when hg<0.9.2
#  >= 2.6: added uploadDirectory
#  >= 2.7: added usePTY option to SlaveShellCommand
#  >= 2.8: added username and password args to SVN class
#  >= 2.9: add depth arg to SVN class
#  >= 2.10: CVS can handle 'extra_options' and 'export_options'
#  >= 2.11: Arch, Bazaar, and Monotone removed
#  >= 2.12: SlaveShellCommand no longer accepts 'keep_stdin_open'
#  >= 2.13: SlaveFileUploadCommand supports option 'keepstamp'
#  >= 2.14: RemoveDirectory can delete multiple directories
#  >= 2.15: 'interruptSignal' option is added to SlaveShellCommand
#  >= 2.16: 'sigtermTime' option is added to SlaveShellCommand
#  >= 2.16: runprocess supports obfuscation via tuples (#1748)
#  >= 2.16: listdir command added to read a directory


class Command(object):
    implements(ISlaveCommand)

    """This class defines one command that can be invoked by the build master.
    The command is executed on the slave side, and always sends back a
    completion message when it finishes. It may also send intermediate status
    as it runs (by calling builder.sendStatus). Some commands can be
    interrupted (either by the build master or a local timeout), in which
    case the step is expected to complete normally with a status message that
    indicates an error occurred.

    These commands are used by BuildSteps on the master side. Each kind of
    BuildStep uses a single Command. The slave must implement all the
    Commands required by the set of BuildSteps used for any given build:
    this is checked at startup time.

    All Commands are constructed with the same signature:
     c = CommandClass(builder, stepid, args)
    where 'builder' is the parent SlaveBuilder object, and 'args' is a
    dict that is interpreted per-command.

    The setup(args) method is available for setup, and is run from __init__.
    Mandatory args can be declared by listing them in the requiredArgs property.
    They will be checked before calling the setup(args) method.

    The Command is started with start(). This method must be implemented in a
    subclass, and it should return a Deferred. When your step is done, you
    should fire the Deferred (the results are not used). If the command is
    interrupted, it should fire the Deferred anyway.

    While the command runs. it may send status messages back to the
    buildmaster by calling self.sendStatus(statusdict). The statusdict is
    interpreted by the master-side BuildStep however it likes.

    A separate completion message is sent when the deferred fires, which
    indicates that the Command has finished, but does not carry any status
    data. If the Command needs to return an exit code of some sort, that
    should be sent as a regular status message before the deferred is fired .
    Once builder.commandComplete has been run, no more status messages may be
    sent.

    If interrupt() is called, the Command should attempt to shut down as
    quickly as possible. Child processes should be killed, new ones should
    not be started. The Command should send some kind of error status update,
    then complete as usual by firing the Deferred.

    .interrupted should be set by interrupt(), and can be tested to avoid
    sending multiple error status messages.

    If .running is False, the bot is shutting down (or has otherwise lost the
    connection to the master), and should not send any status messages. This
    is checked in Command.sendStatus .

                        should be placed

        - ['mode']:     one of update/copy/clobber/export, defaults to 'update'

        - ['revision']: (required) If not None, this is an int or string which indicates
                        which sources (along a time-like axis) should be used.
                        It is the thing you provide as the CVS -r or -D
                        argument.

                        which contains a patch that should be applied after the

                        makes sense to use this in conjunction with a

                        is a string in standard unified diff format. The patch

                        the patch process fails (rejected hunks).

        - ['timeout']:  seconds of silence tolerated before we kill off the
                        command

        - ['maxTime']:  seconds before we kill off the command

        - ['retry']:    If not None, this is a tuple of (delay, repeats)
                        which means that any failed VC updates should be
                        reattempted, up to REPEATS times, after a delay of
