from twisted.internet import reactor
from twisted.python import log
from twisted.spread import pb
from twisted.spread.pb import PBClientFactory


class AutoLoginPBFactory(PBClientFactory):
    """Factory for PB brokers that are managed through a ClientService.

    The methods inherited from ClientFactory through PBClientFactory aren't
    called by ClientService, so there's no point inheriting them. Some of
    them are worth calling from here, though, to limit code duplication.

    Like PBClientFactory, but if the connection fails or is lost, the factory
    will attempt to reconnect.

    GR these two paragraphs below are instructions for users, not description
    of what happens.

    Instead of using f.getRootObject (which gives a Deferred that can only
    be fired once), override the gotRootObject method. GR -> yes in case a user
    would use that to be notified of root object appearances, it wouldn't
    work. But getRootObject() can itself be used as much as one wants.


    Instead of using the newcred f.login (which is also one-shot), call
    f.startLogin() with the credentials and client, and override the
    gotPerspective method.

    gotRootObject and gotPerspective will be called each time the object is
    received (once per successful connection attempt). You will probably want
    to use obj.notifyOnDisconnect to find out when the connection is lost.

    If an authorization error occurs, failedToGetPerspective() will be
    invoked.

    To use me, subclass, use in a ClientService, with ``onConnection`` added as
    ``whenConnected()`` callback

    More GR notes:
    - whenConnected() is fired upon connection *before* banana protocol neg
      so that basically, login() ends with:
         " The client selected a protocol the server didn't "
         "suggest and doesn't know: disconnecting."
    - whenConnected() is useless for behaviour upon reconnection, re-registering
      again on an active connection results in a immediate call
    - also pb is reentrant wrt the factory, and really expects it to be a
      ClientFactory, in that upon dialect selection, banana calls
      self.connectionReady(), which in turn in case of the pb protocol will
      call the factory's clientConnectionMade(). Using pb with a plain factory
      is therefore not that meaningful.

      All this together suggests to keep the changes minimal.
